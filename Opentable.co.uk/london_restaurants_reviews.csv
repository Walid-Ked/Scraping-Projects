3,97620,"The different types of mozzarella were amazing; however, the mains did not match at all. The waiter was intrusive, spoke very much and did not take into account when we asked to be speedy, as we were running out of time. After this note, he did not come to our table to take the dessert orders for 15 minutes. As a result, we gave up and ordered no dessert.",2,3.0,4.0,1.0,2.0,2018-03-11

5,203580,This place is fantastic. We walked in for lunch yesterday and staff have welcomed us very warmly. When we looked at the menu we couldn&#039;t make our mind for quite long time as everything looked delicious. In the end I had chicken schnitzel and my partner had prawn dog. It was so nice that we decided to book in for dinner same day. This time sushi and cheeseburger spring rolls for starters and bbq rib and rib eye burgers for mains. Best ever had. Recommend for everyone. Definitely will visit again when in London.,5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2021-08-02

10,102474,I am a huge fan of the Ham Yard. It has been my go to for several years. But I suspect they are struggling to find good staff. <br /><br />Let’s start with the chef. I had pea broth which was way over salted. Literally not possible to eat. We all fished out the peas and left the broth. <br /><br />The mains were at the typical high quality I expect of the Ham Yard. The coffee we ordered never arrived.<br /><br />Given all the above they gave us a desert for free - without being promoted. But we would have preferred a better experience and to have paid for the desert. <br /><br />The service was ok. But we are used to so much more from the Ham Yard. We are used to a genuine friendliness matched by professionalism. Here it was stiff and not always friendly.<br /><br />I will go again based on my memories of the place but I hope they find their way back to how they were.<br /><br />The decor of course was beautiful. They have really got that right.,3,2.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2021-06-24

Our waiter was delightful, the food (three of us had the special - turbot - which was well cooked and served with peas and pancetta) was very nice and the wine (a NZ Sauvignon Blanc) delicious. It was a quiet night, so noise levels were low and we were able to have a great conversation. Definitely one for the Central London list...",4,4.0,4.0,5.0,4.0,2017-01-03
35,102474,"Ham Yard is a favourite of ours The décor is gorgeous and the ambience is warm and inviting.  There&#039;s always a buzz about the place.  This visit we had a pre-theatre meal which at £20 for 3 courses was great value for money.  However, the drinks are expensive and when service charge added it&#039;s always a bit of a shock!  That aside, it&#039;s still a great place to go for very good quality and tasty food, beautifully presented and served by excellent friendly staff who certainly know their stuff.

40,102474,"I had previously visited the Ham Yard Hotel for dinner in August.  We were initially blown away by the food, setting and ambiance, however it there were 8 of us at our table, the restaurant was packed, and as a result the service was understandably not entirely up to scratch.<br /><br />When friends visiting from overseas requested dinner somewhere they that &#039;ticks all the boxes&#039;, I was hoping that the quality of service would have lifted in 5 months and that a great night would be had by all.<br /><br />We booked dinner for four people, before 7pm and although it was a Friday night, there were only a handful of tables seated.<br /><br />Once again, the food was delicious, the waitstaff friendly, and the atmosphere fantastic.<br />However, the speed at which our meals came out was dismal.  My visiting guests had to leave no less than 3 hours into the meal (and half-way through their main courses) as they were literally falling asleep in their food.  A real shame given I was looking forward to sampling the beautiful desserts I had tasted on my last visit/<br /><br />Having to wait that long for food has made me second guess the service of this beautiful establishment yet again, and regrettably I think it will be a while before my next visit.",3,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2015-01-16
41,102474,Couldn&#039;t hear other person talk in the restaurant as the bar music is so loud.  Music is blasted out.  Fine if you want to be in the funky bar but not if you wish to talk. Only 2 of us - difficult to hear - hopeless if you were in a group of 8.....had to shout!  Need to switch off music in restaurant area and let the noise just carry through. Bar/restaurant area are not enclosed. Hopeless for a business lunch. Staff moved us to orangerie area but it was still noisy and not decorated for fine dining. Staff twere very good though. Plenty of them. Food fair. Not a big menu. Delicious pavlova. Roast pork should come with apple sauce. Veal fillet too thick. Food could be a lot better. Prefer to eat at your Sumner Place Hotel! Cool decor though.,2,2.0,1.0,4.0,2.0,2014-08-30

60,92079,"We came to Hawksmoor on a whim and a google search for highly rated restaurants near the Prince of Whales Theater.  Initially I was concerned that the restaurant was trying to be fancy for the sake of being fancy, but after I arrived and received my food I discovered the true reason for the hype.<br /><br />The beef dripping fries were absolutely amazing.  Something as simple and abundant as fries has been given the chance to stand on its own and destroy the flavor scale.  The gin beverages were all delicious and my Ribeye was cooked perfectly.  My wife got the 3-course pre-theater meal and absolutely loved it. <br /><br />We met with friends the next morning and recommended Hawksmoor and they immediately made reservations.

They had even taken note that it was our anniversary and my boyfriend&#039;s birthday and piped messages on our desserts!

I have been to the Hawksmoor Air Street on 6 or 7 occasions and Seven Dials on 3 occasions as well and this the worst trip I have had. The waiter was not that understandable in terms of English language and a bit over zealous in his approach. The starters were good  but the fillet steaks were over cooked and to dry, very unusual for this place, very disappointing as I had taken my kids as I usually attend for business dinners and to be honest I could&#039;ve cooked the steaks better at home. Medium was requested by us all but they were medium well really and dry, certainly not a £32 piece of meat. The overall bill for 2 adults an 18 year old (2 beers) and a 16 year old (non drinker) was around £320, no where near worth it to be honest.

187,14449,A very good dining experience. The one point I request is that the waiting staff are not required to spray &#039;cleaning fluid&#039; on a table every time the table becomes clear. The smell of the cleaning fluid passes to the tables in the 6 yards or so nearest and gets in you nose &amp; throat.

191,14449,"This has become a very mass market affair. What used to be a specialist Argentine upmarket offering has become commoditised to an extreme degree. All very slick and professional, but set for volume above everything. As such I am afraid it has lost a lot of its charm and indeed appeal. Everything is aimed at high volume throughput  with tables not only tiny but extremely cramped. Literally 0 sense of privacy as even if you try your hardest you cannot avoid hearing everything your neighbouring table is saying. It is in fact so cramped that waiters have difficulties serving you as the fact that there is 0 space between the tables does not allow them to move. Service is really hit and miss as waiters seem simply overwhelmed. Prices are very high nonetheless. A meal for 2 with 2 starters and 2 main courses with only 1 glass of wine came to in excess of 80 sterling per person, a total of &gt; 160 sterling. When taking into account the fact that this was a medium quality food and ambience as well as service experience this was very expensive even for a city as expensive as London. For this price there is substantially better.",3,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2016-07-15
192,14449,"Had a lovely evening with family and friends. Overall  it was a great experience although you need a torch where the mood lighting is very dark. We were  moved back and forth from bar to table on different floors and although there are plenty of staff  wearing their head sets, they don&#039;t actually communicate to guests where they are going and so you stand in the door way a little lost hoping you don&#039;t embarrass yourself by asking another diner for your table instead of a member of staff.  <br /><br />Overall, food really nice, but being a food fan as I am the fat chips were pretty floppy and not crispy or that appealing….don&#039;t think any light would have improved them!  As this was for a special occasion I didn&#039;t make a fuss as I didn&#039;t want to create a negative atmosphere. <br /><br />I would still recommend Gauchos as it&#039;s a nice experience and a lot of fun with nice company. I think looking at the walls that it&#039;s probably best they lights are dimmed because the decor needs cleaning and refreshing….. and I&#039;m certain that&#039;s more costly than adding a few light bulbs :0)",5,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2016-04-23

198,14449,"I booked a table at Gauchos Picadilly on Saturday 13th December for my partners birthday and I can only describe the experience as awful! This was our 6th visit to a Gauchos restaurant, our first at Picadilly.   Our table was booked at 1945, but we weren&#039;t sat until 2005. No one offered to take my coat, and we were made to wait just outside the toilets in the entrance area as the bar was so full. Another guest even asked my partner how long his table would be as he thought he was a  member of staff as there was no one around to assist! It was pandemonium!   When we finally sat down, we ordered our food and the first option my parent went for had &#039;sold out&#039;. Another was recommended so he ordered that, but was told 10 minutes later that was also sold out! He ordered the final recommendation - £13 more in price than the option he originally had asked for. He felt no choice but to just order it as we had been waiting so long!   At the end of our meal, we were rushed out away from our table and made to wait in the cold for the waitress to find a card machine that actually worked!   If this had been our first visit to a gauchos restaurant, then we certainly wouldn&#039;t be coming back! We have had such good service at Charlotte St, Canary Wharf and in Leeds, that this birthday meal out was such a let down!   We will certainly not be frequenting gauchos picadilly again and will advise our friends against the restaurant as well.   I just hope that this was a &#039;one off&#039; experience for us!

It seems like the staff here are pretentious and arrogant - attitudes which I feel are unjustified as the food was actually also sub-par and the ambience was pretty much non-existent.

All the dim sum is excellent as usual, although the noodle dish we had was nothing to be excited about, quite simple without any different flavours. Stick to dim sum.

452,104076,"Not quite on par<br /><br />Having eaten at other Ramsay establishments including Petrus we thought we&#039;d give this one a try pre theatre. Firstly, I should say the level of service is excellent and a tribute to Gordon - staff were polite, gracious and friendly. <br /><br />My partner had a red pepper and tomato soup that was rather good and I chose the Beef Carpaccio with Barigoule vegetables, quail egg and horseradish - this was a wonderful dish so I was quietly excited about the mains - I should say that starters such as this are easy to get right so it is not an indication of what will follow!<br /><br />My partner chose the battered cod, chips and peas which was reasonably good. I chose Cornish Cod filet, crushed potatoes, capers, brown shrimps and butter sauce. What I received was cod filet on crushed potatoes with an insipid parsley sauce! Worse still was the fact that it was too salty overall and there were dense patches of saltiness that made my tongue curl! Unusually, I didn&#039;t complain because we were pressed for time but I would have expected more.<br /><br />I wanted to rate this establishment &#039;good&#039; as opposed to &#039;very good&#039; because of the errors on the mains but the site doesn&#039;t allow this category.

I decided on the fillet steak which was ever so slightly overcooked for medium rare how I asked for it however the food was great especially the spicy tuna tartare... was it value for money... sadly no...and the service very attentive...I would agree with other reviews that the music is very loud and you end up shouting at each other to have a conversation and as the tables are quite close together you can hear what other people are saying cause they too are shouting to be heard... all in all a nice experience though,4,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2016-11-05

Petrus was as good as ever. however Heddon was extremely dissapointing. service , welcoming, ambiance was good. however the food was inconsistant, running between ok and un edible, with the second being the most. we had the worst wellington ever. served in a wooden plate which didnt look too clean, or was that the darkness of the restaurant?. anyway it was served cold, with cold plates accompaning it, while the little juices were absorbed by the wood (who serves wellington on wood?), and the thick t jelly sauce arriving later, not before we asked. it was thinly sliced, disintagrated and unedible. the manager was very attentive and polite. wanted to compensate us, however we didnt want compensation, we wanted good food. i especially was embaressed since i recommanded the place to the group that was with me.<br />there were issues with the rest of the food as well, such as cold hard french fries , but nothing as bad as the wellington. the place can ruin the whole GR establishment&#039;s reputation if something wont be done urgently with the kitchen.",2,1.0,3.0,3.0,1.0,2016-09-04

Several options on the menu were not available, including the filet and (of course) the Chateaubriand, pork appetizer, etc. In addition, we had to select wine three times as the chosen bottles were not available, including one of only four reds available by the glass, for which they did not even have the decency of at least offering a replacement option to all guests, leaving no full bodied red on the by-the-glass list.  We selected four appetizers and two of the four main courses showed up first before any of the appetizers.  When the proper time for the main courses arrived, the earlier returned two mains were MIA and had to be waited on for a few minutes.  While the manager came to apologize later and graciously offered a plate of desserts (which we would not have ordered as we were not in the mood for dessert any longer, therefore giving us something we were not that excited about), the experience was way below expectations, and we felt the compensation was not in line with the multiple mishaps throughout the evening.",2,3.0,2.0,1.0,2.0,2015-10-30

Whilst my Tuna Tartar was good, my main (steak) was average. Dessert was better (Chocolate Fondant was very good).

We enjoyed the restaurant but were disappointed with the meat which tasted like a regular roast meat. The flavours of smoke and coals were not there at all which is disappointing and very surprising, almost bizarre. <br />The sides lacked wow factor and were fairly small. <br />We enjoyed a delicious dessert and were taken care of very well by the staff.",3,3.0,4.0,5.0,2.0,2017-06-17

681,109758,Fun place (although a bit noisy). Great decor. Delicious food and vodka. The waiter was fun and friendly but brought us the wrong main course....thus the 4 instead of 5 stars!,4,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2019-05-31
682,109758,Decided to try this restaurant following a recommendation. Charming interior and service were accompanied by traditional Russian fayre with perhaps a little more panache. I had the special of barley and wild mushroom soup while my companion enjoyed the borscht. We tried eat stuffed buns and then the pelmeni. I felt the broth was a little too salty but it was full of flavour. The price without wine was very reasonable. Great experience.,4,4.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2018-09-25
683,109758,"Unfortunately, that was not a best choice. The main served on the small breakfast plates were not even hot.<br />There were three of us and nobody happy with a meal :( so we did not take a risk of having desserts there...<br />Not recommended at all.",1,1.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2017-02-18

It&#039;s been tricky to get an evening booking here on a Friday so I booked weeks in advance for 6pm and as we were running a little late they reminded us we had the table until 7:30.

697,82675,"To start with I cannot fault the service. The waiter was really friendly, efficient and helpful - it’s the food that really let things down. Starters were fine. They were tasty and did what they said on the tin. The main courses were the real disappointment. The pasta dishes were incredibly bland and very very watery and the pizzas were bland and very doughy. Steak looked like it had been cooked in a fry pan. Overall, 7 fairly unfussy eaters left full but no one said their meal was good. The wines and the cocktails were very nice but £17 for a glass of chianti classico is also a bit on the steep side. <br /><br />Overall,  I would say it’s a good place to go for a drink and some nibbles but don’t go for dinner. Italian is supposed to be simple food done really well. This was simple but not great.",1,1.0,3.0,5.0,2.0,2021-07-31

Service was ok but a little slow and one of the waiters didn&#039;t understand when we asked for &#039;bread on the side&#039;!  But we then got free bread because of the slow service!<br />It was also a hot day and downstairs was really quite hot!  It is a good fun place.  The bar seat area looks fun if you just want nibbles and upstairs is lovely.",4,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2017-08-23
702,82675,We thought the choice for a set menu was very ggood and the glass of prosecco was full! Our guest had a birthday which we did not know about when booking.

703,82675,"We visited Mele e Pere last weekend with friends and we were all really impressed with the restaurant. I struggled to choose as so many of the menu options were so appealing, and they also offered a great value offer menu with three courses for £22.50 which is amazing value. All our meals were cooked to perfection and the ambience at the restaurant was very relaxed. I highly recommend this restaurant if you like honest, good Italian food at reasonable prices. The only small downside is we sometimes had to wait to get attention from the staff, but they were all very friendly and polite when we did.",4,4.0,4.0,3.0,4.0,2016-03-26

705,82675,Overall we enjoyed a fun family dinner. The furniture is &quot;mix and match&quot; with varying table and chair seat heights so check to make sure the set up works for you. Food was good and portions generous. They missed a main course for our party which was unfortunate. Wine list interesting  but we had to switch white wine when they ran out.

We had a Saturday evening booked so it was busy and the atmosphere was great. The only thing, of course because it was busy, was that we had our starters before we even had a chance to order drinks and had to ask twice to order wine.

709,82675,Its very cute that it is called Mele E Pere - Apples and Pears as it is cockney rhyming slang for &#039;Stairs&#039; and this restaurant is basically a staircase and a few tables on the street level and the majority of the establishment is underground . Unfortunately i think the atmosphere is underground also and we had a table on the street level . The service was good but at times a bit distracting .The food was very tasty but small portions and some courses were a little garlic reliant for my taste . I think this place would be great for a business lunch or for groups . Its location was great for people watching in the streets of Soho - highlight of the meal was the Tiramisu which was frankly the best I have ever had it was absolutely gorgeous .

710,82675,Enjoyed a first visit to this restaurant - lively downstairs dining area with a happy mostly youthful clientele. Good atmosphere and service from friendly staff group. Probably too noisy and bustling for quiet one-to-ones or romantic nights out but plenty of West End buzz in the heart of Soho. Liked the fact that prosecco was served on tap in jugs and the brilliant window display upstairs!,4,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2013-05-30
711,82675,"A Soho surprise, especially because there are so many Italian options in this part of town. We opted for the lunch special at a bargain £8.50 per dish and a delicious, generous portion of saffron risotto and a traditional meat lasagne was delivered, piping hot and with a smile. Good desserts and fabulous country wine list to choose from. We went early lunchtime and sat upstairs which was light and comfortable. Never went downstairs to view rest of space. Meanwhile, would highly recommend.",4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2013-02-28
712,82675,"I had walked past Mele E Pere before and was intrigued by the colourful window display, which is presumably the intention. We decided to visit later on, and went for their set menu. This limits the choices obviously, but what we had was excellent. Great service too. But although the exterior is pretty, for dining I think I actually preferred the basement room - we ate on the benches upstairs. Thoroughly recommended.",4,4.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2012-10-28
713,82675,"This was my second visit to Mele e Pere, and once again I had a great evening. My friend and I ate off the TopTable 3 courses and a glass of wine for £17.50, which is extremely good value. They were very accommodating with my gluten allergy, double checking everything was suitable with the chef, even offering alternatives if they were not 100% certain. The food was delicious, and overall we had a very enjoyable evening. My only criticism would be that it can get pretty noisy, but I suppose it adds to the feel of the place. I would definitely return again.",4,4.0,4.0,4.0,5.0,2012-06-26
714,102903,"We could not stop laughing all night. It was more like a series of unfortunate events. We pointed to our table instead of shown we had to request to see a menu, our food took forever and to top it all off a waitress spilled a glass of rain water all over my partner and didn’t bring him any napkins or anything. It was fun but we would only return for drinks. The food was very over priced in comparison to what you actually got.",3,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2021-07-31

716,102903,"The place is ok, the tapas are delcious, the waiters are all super nice but overall its a bit too expensive at the end of the day for a simple tapas place! Only the beer is cheaper, everything else has the price of a restaurant and this is definitely not a restaurant. The small tables for 2 are very unconfortable especially next to the entrance and close to the tapas bar where there is insane movement all the time.",3,3.0,2.0,4.0,2.0,2020-02-07

718,102903,The staff were very welcoming and  helpful.<br />There was a large variety of tapas to choose from - and they were very tasty. My only quibble is that many of the tapas were on ciabatta.

719,102903,"Food was superb, as were the staff. It&#039;s a great little venue and was perfect for our pre-theatre dinner. The tapas is changing with each refresh which is great. Because there&#039;s no waiting time, you wander straight up with your plate, it makes it all seem a little robotic - you can of course pace yourself but I think we were in and out in 35mins, which is fine for pre-theatre. Also you only get a table for 90mins, so if you wanted to enjoy the dinner as the feature of the evening, this is not the place. For pre-theatre food though, excellent.",4,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2015-09-05

Small scrambled egg and (not much) salmon for £8.50 and toast is extra at £2.95 per 1½ slices. The toast also came 2 mins after the egg, which had gone cold.

Foods are fancy looking tasteless and cold imitation. My kebab wasn’t even cooked enough and served right. And they charge way too much for these failed attempts.

The sangria was fine, however the caprinha pitcher seemed to be 80% sugar, could barely taste the lime or alcohol.<br /><br />Oh, and when the bill arrived they had the cheek to add a cover charge!<br /><br />Sadly, would not recommend, the food was fine but the service really put a dampener on the night.",2,3.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,2021-08-02

Staff were attentive and explained the new “safety &amp; hygiene” features, food was great and it was definitely value for money. <br /><br />Only critique is that staff were the only ones to select your cold buffet items (which is understandable). You were allowed to get up and view the items and make a selection but after my first selection, I didn’t want to ask a waiter for more cold buffet items - the “meat waiters” came around to the table very frequently but it would have been nice for the cold buffet waiters to take one more visit to the table to ask if we wanted to anything else.

So you had to keep them in your own place, therefore reducing the amount of space in your plate, until your plate is full. That kinda made no sense.<br /><br />Overall though, a good experience!

Our waitress was so tired/irritable that she was pouring wine in a very splashy manner without properly ensuring it wasn&#039;t splashing us. Worse, rushing, she knocked a glass full off wine over while trying to attend our table - I fortunately avoided any spilt wine on my dress.<br /><br />While I do appreciate that staff can be tired (as all of us!), I must admit that training at Rowley&#039;s is not what I had been expecting from past experiences.

I then had the sea bass wrapped in a banana leaf and my mum had the lamb massaman curry and the sauce was far too sweet for a main dish. A proper massaman curry should have a coconut based sauce. This tasted like it had coconut and sugar put together for the sauce and was disgusting. I then had the mango cheesecake for afters which tasted very rubbery. Again this could have been so much better. I&#039;ve had far nicer Thai meals in London and would definitely not return. The bill was over £100 for two of us with wine and we&#039;ve had far nicer and cheaper meals in London and would not recommend this restaurant.

The good news is that we could enjoy an after dinner drink in the other terrace.... Would go again but rather for a drink,3,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2013-07-16

Just a little on the pricy side and a little tailored for the European market. <br /><br />We had aubergine and a large bowl of smacked cucumbers to start with - I could have had two bowls of the cucumbers they were so full of umami flavour. Cold sesame chilli chicken was not spicy but tasty and sat on the most delicious little salad. Kung pao prawns were large, juicy and delicious. Water spinach was fine. The mung bean noodles with cabbage were so good that, if I&#039;d known, I would have had just a big bowl of that. There&#039;s a good selection of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks available,<br /><br />Tables are comfortable and large enough that you don&#039;t have to worry about dishes falling off the ends (not always true in Chinese restaurants).

Everything was running very smooth until the serving of our food and the waiter got both the delivery of the starters &amp; main courses mixed up to at least 3 of us on each course!!!! The only other gripe was the hurried chase from our table &quot;as they needed to set up for the evening &quot; this was a little embarrassing as when I requested to go have a table at the bar we were informed they had none available.

1034,5466,"Overall, the Fortnum and Mason tea salon was disappointing on this occasion.  We had looked forward to an excellent afternoon tea experience, based upon a previous time when we were absolutely blown away by the service, the food, and the general atmosphere.  Unfortunately, we weren&#039;t left with a similar impression on this occasion.  We were initially escorted to a table in the center of one of the dining rooms, which quickly proved to be quite busy, with staff hastening by every few seconds.  This didn&#039;t exactly make for a relaxed ambiance.  We asked to be reseated, and we patiently waited for a new table, which was tucked away out of the bustle and was better.  However, the service was disappointingly slow and disjointed.  When our waitress initially came by, she simply asked if we had decided on anything.  While we were still mulling over the options, she left us without explaining anything about the menu, which we thought was customary to do.   Once we had ordered, only one out of three of us was brought tea (so only one of us was drinking for several minutes), after which we were waiting an uncomfortable amount of time for the first items of food to arrive.  At one point, our tea had run out and we had been waiting a while on a refill of a few sandwiches.  We felt that our waitress could have been more attentive, as she didn&#039;t come by to check on us, and consequently, we were left to our own devices when items ran out.  It also didn&#039;t help that once we had complained about the service that there was miscommunication between two or three other well-meaning people in terms of what we were missing and had requested.  Double items turned up, while others were still missing.  Overall, our experience wasn&#039;t the best, and this occasion was meant to be a special treat for a dear friend, making it even more disappointing.  I wouldn&#039;t say we would never return, however, we would probably be inclined to opt for a different afternoon tea venue next time.",3,4.0,4.0,1.0,3.0,2019-08-06

But after we were sat down, the &#039;unlucky part&#039; started. We had to wait 10 minutes for a waiter to come and tell us how everything works, than the waiter didn&#039;t see our tea on the counter, so someone else brought it over after 10 minutes. Than we were informed something went wrong in the kitchen and they forgot our order. After waiting for almost 1 hour we finally got our food. It was lovely, but it was hard to get hold of any waiter because they were so busy... I was personally a bit twitchy, because everything was delayed, I was scared we had to give our table away after 1 hour and 30 minutes (they told us at the beginning this was the case...). Luckily this didn&#039;t happen, but it would&#039;ve been nice if someone told us we could take our time.<br />It&#039;s nice that you have the option to take everything home with you (like a doggy bag). But the waiter (I think he was a manager) forget to put our food in a doggy bag and we saw someone else throw away all our food... We told our waiter and he arranged a new doggy bag full of new pastries, which was really nice of him.<br />Overall, I think it was way too crowded and therefor waiters couldn&#039;t follow. It&#039;s sad because we didn&#039;t really get the whole experience and still had to pay a lot of money.

However, the chocolate tart was nice and I was provided with another one of these on request.<br /><br />I prefer more traditional cakes so will probably not go to Fortnums again for afternoon tea.",3,3.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2017-03-20

The service was also very good from the waiting staff.<br /><br />Unfortunately, and most importantly, the reason we went to Fortnum and Mason was for the food! I was expecting a top quality food experience, and what we received was nothing close. The sandwiches were fine on the whole, with a good variety and quality was good enough - but I didn&#039;t pay £50+ for a decent sandwich. The scones were ok, although the sweet scones were a bit too hard and dry. The cakes were extremely disappointing as they were all dry except the chocolate ganache cake (but that would be difficult to make dry!). The cakes were also very poor in terms of taste as well. The food was just simply not good enough and extremely disappointing as has put me off afternoon tea altogether for now.<br /><br />As a side note, and this is not a unique problem to Fortnum by any means, but I was looking forward to enjoying some nice teas, but the problem is, once you pour your tea, it gets cold so quickly that you barely get a chance to drink and enjoy your tea as all you are left with is half a cup of cold tea - and what do you do with this?

Sandwiches were pre plated (no stand!) and you had to ask for seconds as you did the savoury treats (scones etc) didn&#039;t like that as you felt greedy (only 1 canapé of each choice per person for savoury treats) why not 2 we were a party of 2!! Only one piece of cake offered for afters.. Only 1 pot of tea each. Last time I came it was sumptuous and we even took home our little sweet treats we could not manage. This time there was nothing left to take and we came away hungry and disappointed. The only good thing was the food was tasty and the bottle of champagne.

1100,5466,"Our daughter and son treated us to afternoon tea at Fortnum and Mason&#039;s to celebrate our Ruby Wedding Anniversary.  The service was excellent and the food very good, but, as much as we enjoyed it, we felt it was far too expensive for what is essentially sandwiches and cakes!  For £90 we could have had a very good three course dinner!  Honestly, £90?  The fashion for afternoon tea seems a nice little earner nowadays.<br /><br />The setting of the restaurant is lovely, and of course afterwards Fortunum&#039;s is a great place to shop.  Quite touristy nowadays though - something I don&#039;t recall from the 1970s when I worked nearby and regularly visited, but maybe I&#039;m remembering with rose tinted glasses.<br /><br />Anyway, overall I would recommend - so long as money is no object.

It did not disappoint.

1181,167259,"Having been recommended this restaurant as a nice place for lunch, we were disappointed to find that it was quite empty and mismatched from an ambience/decor point of view in the context of its enviable location. Generally my hallmark of a good Indian eatery is the masala chai, so despite the intense heat outside that was my choice of drink; unfortunately it tasted like tea-flavoured water and it was clear that it was a teabag chai rather than authentic - unfortunately first impressions make a huge impact because despite the food being reasonable in terms of taste, I wasn’t wowed overall. <br /><br />The dahi puri had a tasty filling but the puri itself was a touch stale, the chicken kathi roll wasn’t much to rave about and this was the limited menu - I was unfortunately fooled by the exuberant, colourful pictures of the food prior to coming here and I think the main items which were showcased on various review sites had been stopped due to COVID (eg. Okra fries, etc.). Big disappointment. <br /><br />In future, I’d probably take the time to walk a few more steps towards Carnaby street and just get my Indian fix from Dishoom instead.",3,4.0,2.0,3.0,2.0,2021-07-18

1185,145806,"We dined on a Monday lunchtime so it was very quiet, maybe some background music would help? We ordered 3 courses each, all different dishes to try as much as possible. Lobster salad was fantastic as was the beef tartare but the seared tuna was a bit uninspiring. Main courses; the lamb was cooked and rested well but the smokey pepper was the dominating flavour of the dish and took away from the lamb/aubergine/tapenade. The dexter beef was cooked well but the borlotti beans were undercooked. The brill with coco beans was the standout dish. Side dishes of tomato salad, green beans and creamed spinach were all fine but the portion of spinach was pitiful. For dessert we had lemon custard tart - lovely pastry but needed more lemon! The salted caramel tart with ice cream was nice but too sweet. I think a milk or yoghurt ice cream/sorbet would have balanced it better. The strawberry sorbet with tea cake was actually raspberry sorbet! And the teacake that was supposed to accompany it didn’t arrive. We did mention this to the waiter who said he would check with the chef but he didn’t return. Petit fours of 3 different chocolate shards were tasty albeit a little boring, I was expecting something nicer for a restaurant of this standard in Browns Hotel. Service was friendly enough. It’s not cheap to dine here and I probably wouldn’t return as there were a lot of things missing.",3,3.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2021-08-02

Easily one, if not the best fillet steaks I’ve had. The waiting staff, especially David were fabulous! <br />One of my biggest peeves is when waiters come and ask you how the food is, every 5 minutes especially when youve got food in your mouth, and there was none of that, which was a very welcomed addition. <br />The finishing touch was the little note on our desserts wishing us a happy anniversary.

Only later we discovered that it was £70 and had we just ordered what we originally wanted, it would have been £44 all together. I thought that was really poor. <br /><br />I eat in Mayfair\ Chelsea all the time and don’t mind shelling out for food - in fact trying out new restaurants is my pass time - but I must also get value for money and not just feel that I have paid in excess for a basic meal and pretty much just funded the restaurants overheads, rent and rates,",1,1.0,4.0,1.0,1.0,2018-10-19

We found the bland, very little taste which even needed proper seasoning - i.e. salt. The main dish was 30 pounds and was two chunks of plain tasting paneer on some chole - which was kind of an insult. Vegetable side dishes lacked any care and attention and were simply tossed to make something the chefs thought passable for consumption. We mentioned the issues with the food, and the waiters did bring something that was much better - so that was something. The food was however way overpriced and nothing special at all - even when it was redone.

Although there appeared to be an abundance of service staff, there were long intervals between being offered and served drinks, then having the food order taken.

1264,88120,"My initial impression was that Thursday nights were not the best night for 1:1 dining for couples as the majority of clientele were business people, one or two with laptops on display and the volume of noise was very high. Service was very attentive but perhaps a bit over the top. We chose Crispy Soft Shell Crab which was a bit too greasy but rest of dish was nice. He had King Prawn, Scallop &amp; Squid which he enjoyed. I had the chicken which was tasty. We were dis-suaded from over-ordering extras. Desserts were good.<br />The bill £210 was astronomical - while the food was good, it was not outstanding or indeed the best ever, but you are paying for location and all the personal attention. We vowed this second visit was our last.",3,3.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2012-09-19
1265,88120,I just enjoyed a truly inspiring meal at Benares. The food was excellent. Whilst the portions were not huge by the end of the meal I was satisfied.<br /><br />It worked out at around £100pp but we drank about £42 of cocktails each. So the meal and the wine pairing set us back around £58pp. Please try the wine pairing it really did make a difference.<br /><br />If you want to be made to feel special and you want to sample the delights of some seriously quality food and receive quality service do one thing.

Only criticisms: glasses of wine with the set menu were very small, the  toilets could have been cleaned more regularly the automatic addition of a service charge also annoyed me. This is unfortunate for the staff who, had I not been cajoled in this way, would probably have received more than the 12.5%.

1303,98529,"We had initially booked for the Sunday brunch but due to one of our friends being pregnant and one being vegetarian and the inflexibility of the brunch menus (we asked for some broccoli as an option to the £39 menu as the only vegetarian small plate was miso soup and our pregnant friend couldn&#039;t have most of the seafood small plates and were told this was not possible) we ended up ordering from the normal menu. We suspected our waiter was fairly new as he didn&#039;t know the menu well, was unhelpful and pretty inattentive. Due to how busy it is during Sunday brunch areas there is a strict 2 hour turnaround for your table. We struggled to get our waiter&#039;s attention to order and just after we finally ordered dessert we were told by three different members of staff that the table was needed back - when the delay isn&#039;t your fault, this makes the end of your meal quite stressful.

Needless to say, as the restaurant filled up, it got progressively louder to the point at which my friend and I could not hear each at all! So much for a nice evening &#039;catch up&#039; with a friend!<br /><br />We ordered the California roll and Spicy Tuna roll, which, in addition to being over priced was INCREDIBLY bad tasting and disappointing. Tasted as though it was caught from the sea and not washed and wrapped into a roll.

The pork I had as my main course was totally bland and had no flavour and was crispier that pork scratchings. Further to this, for the poor food I received I still ended up paying £100 for myself and my girlfriend.

This was particularly true of the signature dish “Peking Duck”. When the “crispy” skin finally arrived, it was already placed on the wrap with the scallions and was quite rubbery and disappointing - certainly not worth the 100 pound price tag.<br />Otherwise, good ambiance and attentive service, although here too, a bit rushed.",3,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2018-12-29

1359,52804,"You don&#039;t notice it so much on the outside of the restaurant but inside is really dark and loud. Took my boyfriend there for his birthday and he loved the food. We ordered dim sum and duck rolls for starters. The stir fry beef in merlot was delicious and so was the stir fry Peking duck. We&#039;re not massively greedy so we definitely couldn&#039;t finish our food as well as drink cocktails. So we left the rice and Singapore noodles which I&#039;m not a massive fan of anyway. We ordered the Jivara bomb for desert which was like a cold chocolate moouse ice cream in crunchy Rice Krispies which the waiter poured a chocolate sauce over. Tasted so good! They so kindly piped happy birthday for my boyfriend on the plate and it had a subtle yet classy candle for his birthday. Cocktails were nice, I&#039;ve always like a hakkatini, it doesn&#039;t taste like alcohol so before you know it your tipsy after a few. The atmosphere was ok, really loud in there and a mixture of different people. You don&#039;t have to dress up unless you want to. I mean we was because we out after but there&#039;s people in there that&#039;s just come from shopping in Oxford street to those that go all out glam. It&#039;s a good place for sharing food if you like to try different things. Just be warned it really hot in there. The less clothes the better. I would go again but not in a rush. I went to the one in New York while I was there and it was a bit more chilled and not to crammed together. We were sat between two larger groups. One super loud and bit annoying as the women kept getting up for the &quot;loo&quot; and the others were chilled and looked like they just came for the food.

At first we were seated in a wrong area in which they had to seat us to another area, which was fine and just glad that the food wasn&#039;t ordered by then. We just wanted din sum which was all wonderful and Delish! The cocktails was dangerous because they were absolutely yummy delicious! The Hakka cocktail was sublime!

The food was excellent and the set menu offers good value for money. The only criticism I do have is the service was a bit patchy - our waitress was a bit offish and not particularly attentive. For this type of restaurant the service should be more polished &amp; friendly. I would not go back in a rush.

The resemblance to Wagamamas is there but that&#039;s where the parallel stops. The service was excellent and the waitress was knowledgeable and not overly helpful. When the food arrived it didn&#039;t disappoint, however, I think the postcode reflected the high prices more than the quality of some (but by no means all) of the food.

There was a DJ on the decks, and we liked the music, but it felt incongruous in a near-empty restaurant in daylight. Without glittering people or mystique, it just felt a bit bling. It was also expensive - we paid £150+ for a fairly basic lunch for two of us (I think we had a mocktail each). <br />Might be better on a busy evening, when people watching and bar lounging might make it all come together.

1426,121113,"This is my 5th visit to Shakfuyu and i was really let down by the service, especially since i took my friend there for desert. it was slow and inpersonal and we were left to fend for ourselves for the most of time. We only ordered 3 things on the menu but we spent close to 2 hours waiting around. I understand if it was busy but other tables were served a lot faster. I definitely think we were forgotten about and when we finally did get our desert (french toast and matcha icecream) it was luke warm, burnt and just not as good as it used to be, i asked for the bill immediatlet because i didnt know how long it would take to be seen again.

1433,116793,I was expecting to be writing a damning review as the experience started really badly.<br />Arrived a few minutes before 5.45 when our table eas booked for. We were told our table wasn&#039;t ready but we could wait at the bar. No problem we said - we&#039;ll have a drink while we wait.<br />You can&#039;t we were told - no drinks at the bar as we&#039;re too short staffed. (Other couples at the bar had no drinks either except two ladies had glasses of bubbly. When I asked why I was told &quot;this was my colleagues mistake&quot;)<br />I suggested we left and came back later but was assured the wait would only be 5 minutes.<br />30 minutes later my husband went and complained.<br />Miraculously within 3 minutes we were taken to a table.<br />Both feeling pretty irritated but the cocktails and food were delicious and the waiting staff were lovely.<br />I will go back but the initial handling was very poor. My husband was told diners were &quot;outstaying their welcome&quot;. He asked then why weren&#039;t they asked to leave? Obviously no answer could be given.<br />I wonder how long we&#039;d have had to wait if we hadn&#039;t complained?

Although it is noisy in the restaurant you are able to hold a perfectly normal conversation. The music is very much in the background and could do with being a bit louder as you could often only hear a constant drone base line. The service was good but I didn’t like that staff constantly walked around with iPads noting if you had nearly finished or not, it made us feel like we had to hurry. There was also a lot of staff walking around directing other members of staff to do things, we found it odd that they didn’t just clear a table or 2 or make the odd Coffee themselves!?

1512,116793,"I&#039;m a regular here but am watching it deteriorate - it is no longer &#039;special&#039; as there are too many &#039;off the street&#039; diners not really dressed for a highish end place - getting far too casual and most would be better suited to the  shake shack opposite.  When you make an effort for an occasion and are met with T shirts and leggings it is a little off putting particularly when there are many other options to be taken in the area.  No idea what this restaurant can do to deter this drop in standard but I may find myself at Joe Allens or Sheekey&#039;s or the Delaunay in future.

My partner had the beef wellington special which was great and my duck main course was just right. The wine was a little pricier than I was expecting to pay, but taste-wise was worth it.

My latte was like an americano with milk, seriously bad barista skills and coffee tasted like starbucks.  Eggs benedict whilst attractive in composition was cold, if it had been hot I&#039;m sure it would have been very nice.  Service quite bad, chap that brought a juice to the table turned on his heels whilst I was asking for coffee so I had to wait for ages for another staff member to come along - how hard is it to ask the table is everyone ok for drinks?

Also when asking to remove the &quot;optional&quot; service charge off an already pricey (yet very nice) meal, they saw it necessary to send the manager over to question this.

Our tea was only poured for one of the three of us drinking it, we had to ask for milk and our food was greasy. When we asked for the bill we were left waiting for over 20mins and when we asked the maître d&#039; we were told the waiter should have brought it, no apology and got a bit of attitude.

Upon arrival we were given a glass of prosecco each for our anniversary, nice touch, although we had to wait about 10 minutes for it. This was a Saturday night and it looked like a reduced menu from the website - I was looking forward to the soft shell crab taco... I never had a starter but my wife had the chicken wings which apparently were great, juicy and plump. I had the porterhouse steak and at £37.00 just for the steak - I don&#039;t think it was worth it. It was cooked perfectly but it arrived luke warm and I&#039;ve had better at other restaurants for cheaper. My wife had the off the bone prime cut which again was cooked perfectly but lacking in warmth. The fries were as they should be and the hispi cabbage side dish was  delicious. I had the bananaramadrama which considering it is a deep fried Mars bar with banana bread, the Mars bar was cold. My wife enjoyed the Nutella cookie.

There is a wide menu with lots of options so there is something for all culinary tastes. I had the mutton curry which was delicious and the portions are generous.

Table wasn&#039;t quite ready when we arrived but don&#039;t usually mind waiting in bar with a drink - although nobody arrived to offer one despite being given the drinks menu... while we waited I asked for food menu so we could think about our wine choices. Restaurant was busy as expected but service at the table was poor. At least half an hour for wine order, and when our food order was taken 5 minutes later we were told there was a number of items off the menu... Including our choices.  Tuna Tataki starter was beautifully presented and fresh, although I&#039;m not entirely sure the sprinkling of rice cracker snacks would have accompanied it had there not been renovations pending and the kitchen de-stocking ahead of time. Main course of sirloin steak was cooked to our liking but an expensive alternative to our original choices (and second choices) which were both off the menu. That aside the staff were discrete polite and as we were one of the last tables left didn&#039;t rush us to leave.

1595,127284,I was craving Greek food and my flight was coming up. I checked on OpenTable and found suvlaki in the neighborhood SoHo. So attentive and so delicious. You have to have the tasziki it is fresh and creamy and lovely. I also had the mini lamb souvlaki without potatoes they should never put potatoes in it and was delicious by itself the beats were pickled fresh and the lamb was incredibly tender and cooked perfectly. I&#039;ve had like this before but this was the best I&#039;ve had in a long time. I also tried to pull pork and orzo starter which was really tasty and interesting. I will definitely be back.,5,5.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2018-03-23

It was hard to attract the attention of the waiters to get hot water for the tea and to get the bill. We split the bill and we were surprised that the instant 3-way split option wasn’t available, neither was contactless. Felt inefficient not quaint. I’d forgotten how noisy it can be when busy!

Sunday night roast beef special was OK, but the accompanying potatoes were terrific.  Did not care for cauliflower au gratin, but my wife liked it and her flank steak was good.

1605,68764,"Could have been so much better. Menu and food excellent. Staff and service poor. Despite having a reservation our table wasn’t ready, we were told to go to the bar to have a drink and we would be called, which was something of a joke. The bar is too small to allow for a pre meal drink. It took some time to get served and there was very limited seating available causing us to stand. We were not called as promised when our table was ready, we had to ask a member of bar staff to chase this for us. Eventually we were seated at a table which we then asked to change. We had requested a table by a wall as two of our party had hearing defects and loud noise caused discomfort and confusion. The staff did oblige eventually, we had to wait for a suitable table to be prepared . The  Wolseley is incredibly noisy which maybe fine for some but does make conversation difficult, also understanding the staff is not easy under such noisy conditions.<br />Having been seated at our new table we were eventually able to order our meal. We were brought bread and butter. Please don’t expect a side plate, you are left to eat your bread directly off the tablecloth. Very odd and not to our liking. We did ask for side plates but just received a smile.<br />Our first course arrived which we all enjoyed, the chopped liver was very good and a very generous portion. Our plates were not cleared but our main course arrived. The waiting staff became flustered and apologised for the error. This then caused, for some reason for us to be pretty much ignored for the rest of the meal. We needed to attract the attention of staff for the dessert menu and then again to order, all of which was unnecessary as the restaurant seemed well staffed. The one aspect of service that did appear very promptly was the bill and rather than leave us for a couple of minutes to check our bill the waiter stood at our table with the credit card machine.",3,5.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2018-07-07
1606,68764,"Food was nice but then again, it is not difficult not to go wrong with mashed avocado on toast with an egg on top.What surprised me was how poor the service was. I had booked a table. When we arrived, there was a huge queue which I can accept but what I found unacceptable was that not a single member of staff was willing to make eye contact with us, let alone explain why there was such a queue. All we wanted to know was that they had our booking and that we would ( eventually) be seated. Once we were seated, everything took an age to arrive- coffee- food menu and the food. The waiters were clearly overstretched and therefore had an air of panic about them and this came across as surliness towards us, the diners. I even witnessed one waiter swearing to another waiter, when he inadvertently bumped into him as they were rushing around.I have been here many, many times before but admittedly my last visit was a year or two ago.

Half way through eating it the waiter took her plate away and exclaimed that they got order wrong, and then placed the correct order (pork chop) down in front of her.  She was not given the choice to finish what they first gave her, and she did not like the pork they served.<br />This being said, Wolseley took the her dinner off our bill.

1664,40357,"Visited Hakkasan many years ago and was blown away by the experience, so we thought we&#039;d redo the experience but it was a disappointment. We went for one of the set signature menus. Most of the dishes were very good, but a few were rather plain, which is maybe to be expected and no cause for complaint. Overall, the staff were rushing us through to have the table set for the next party, which meant that 2 starters were served at the same time and 4 main courses at the same time. So the last main courses were rather cold when we got to them, and the entire meal was stressful. With the last dish came the bill, and when we asked if we could get coffee after dinner, we we&#039;re told we could get that at the bar.  I would not recommend this for a special occasion, but it you&#039;re just in it for the food and you&#039;re willing to pay close to 200 pounds per person for it, this might be the place for you. Be aware also that they add a13,5% service fee on top of the menu price, which would have been OK if it was conditioned to good service, but it&#039;s not.",2,4.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2017-04-01

I would reccomend it if you&#039;re willing to spend at least 65£ per head on a set menu but if you&#039;re a normal person you probably can&#039;t afford it.

The interior is a world away from the bright lights and busy streets of the West End: dark, mysterious, Eastern and romantic. <br /><br />The service is excellent from the cloakroom to bar. Very attentive waiting staff take care of everything surreptitiously.<br /><br />There were few vegetarian options on offer, however, the food was delicious! We had a dim sum platter followed by vegetarian chicken and Singapore noodles. The dishes were presented with simplicity but we&#039;re colourful and appealing. <br /><br />We didn&#039;t order dessert but the staff surprised me with a delicious mango sorbet nestled on a bed of raspberry crumble, complete with Birthday candle. Simply yummy!<br /><br />Last but not least, the cocktail menu is highly recommended!!!<br /><br />It&#039;s not difficult to understand the popularity of Hakkasan.

1674,40357,"We went for the special &quot;Taste of Hakkasan&quot; menu, incredible value for money, but you do have to go in a non-peak time (OK for us as we like to eat late).<br />The atmosphere is really special, beautiful decor. The restaurant is hidden away in a little alleyway off Tottenham Court Road.<br />Service was mostly excellent, all the waiters, servers, coat-check people, etc. were friendly and helpful. <br />Only complaint is that we had quite a long wait between the starter and the main course (with no apology or explanation either) even though the restaurant was not very busy at the time. We weren&#039;t in a hurry so we didn&#039;t really mind, but it was a low point in an otherwise impeccable experience.<br />Quality of food and ingredients is top notch.",5,5.0,5.0,4.0,4.0,2015-08-09
1675,40357,"Our visit to Hakkasan was a birthday treat to my husband. He loves good food and as we live in the north west, we took the opportunity to pay a visit while down south for a friends wedding. The food was wonderful. My husband made some very appreciative noises about the duck spring rolls in particular! The waiter was great. He was very friendly and the restaurant obviously runs like a well oiled machine.<br />My only criticism is that the tables are far too close together. We were sat in between two couples and the man next to me literally had his head in my plate when he went to pick his napkin from under his table. This was a very rare opportunity for us to have some couples time without our young kids.

1678,40357,"This is one of my favourite “special occasion” places.  Although it’s Michelin starred, you don’t need a 2nd mortgage to afford it (although I couldn’t do it every week either!) and the food, service and ambience are everything you’d expect from a star.  We went on a Monday night and it was pretty busy, but we didn’t feel too crowded due to the clever layout/ decor.  Feeling too lazy to choose a la carte, we had the £65 set menu for 2 and an extra dish of soft shell crab.  Each dish was excellent but my favourite was undoubtedly the crab.

1843,82204,"We went for a pre theatre dinner. All of the food we had was not great. My chicken was dry on the inside but it was smothered in too much bbq sauce, as were the ribs. My mum asked for her steak medium rare, it came medium well and was more gristle than meat. The halloumi fries were soggy and rubbery. The Oreo chocolate ice cream sandwich was probably the best thing about the meal and it wasn’t that great either. Cocktails were nice. Quite expensive for a not very enjoyable meal.

1873,17206,Overall I enjoyed the meal at the Tamarind but I felt rushed. The table was booked for 8pm and we were finished on a 2 course dinner by 9:30. For the price of the meal I would have liked to have felt that I was out for the evening rather than feeling I had to be out by 9:30 to accommodate more covers.,4,4.0,5.0,5.0,4.0,2015-08-15
1874,17206,"We booked the Tamarind because it apparently has a Michelin star and we wanted to experience exceptional Indian Cuisine. <br />To be honest the veggie menu options were a bit confusing and advice not helpful. We decided to go for the three course vegetarian menu as this seemed to offer some interesting possibilities. We chose a very nice glass of pinot gris to accompany the first course. This comprised a nicely arranged plate of paneer/potato cake/brocolli with a chick pea salad and minty dressing. It seemed like a good start. <br />For the second course my wife wanted a glass of the Marlborough sauvignon blanc but neither this nor any other Sauvignon was available. Strange for a Michelin starred establishment. It was downhill form there. The second (main) course  was a selection of dahl/spinach/fried potatoes/okra/aubergine/naan bread/rice. But this was not appetizingly or artistically arranged on a plate as one might expect from a Michelin starred chef but rather served as dishes from which we had to help ourselves. Rather as if we had bought ready prepared meals  from Sainsburys and heated them in the microwave. The main taste experience of these dishes was heat. After one round, rather than savouring the different flavours, my mouth was almost chilied out. This was not what I expected - my disappointment was complete. <br />The third course of carrot fudge with raisins, Heritage carrot cake and vanilla ice cream was served decoratively and was fine.<br />We didn&#039;t eat all of the main course and had it boxed to take away. We gave it to a homeless lady on Piccadilly.",2,1.0,3.0,4.0,1.0,2015-02-08
1875,17206,"The food exceeded my expectations in flavour in particular the starters, the kebab was nice and chilli, the tiki was soft and the lamb chop literally was melting in my mouth. All of the dishes were lovely and the service is outstanding- right from the moment we walked in. I would highly recommend this place to friends and family. Being Indian myself it&#039;s one of the best restaurants I&#039;ve been to!

1880,17206,Whilst the food was nice it definately was not outstanding which is what you would expect for the prices that they are charging. The price of the Kebabs is just not worth what you get.

1885,17206,I have been to this restaurant several times and the staff are always extremely attentive but not overbearing. The food is very fresh tasting and it is a cut above most Indian restaurants. The house wines are moderately priced at £19 per bottle. These are a French VdP Viognier (white) and a French VdP Syrah (red). Both the wines are very good and compliment the food perfectly. The rest of the wine list is comprised of a good selection of moderate and expensive wines. Currently on Sundays they are doing a 2 for 1 offer on their tasting menu.

We ordered the now downgraded bread basket that has lost all of the previous theatre - just standard baguette ( no longer warm ) without any of the crispy crostini, focaccia or brik pastry bread! <br /><br />The food was as always top notch but service and timings left something to be desired,  leaving the fish pie and fish stew to cool somewhat between service.

The layout is different in parts as a consequence. It is also now owned by Richard Caring as part of his larger restaurant group.<br /><br />However, the lovely thing is that the ambience is still wonderful and service superb and it retains its quiet glamour and air of effortless luxury. The food still follows the original style and typical range with a few welcome updates. Fish is always well-cooked and fresh and shellfish (particularly oysters and razor clams) superb. Their Fish Pie remains a reliable standard, ditto potted shrimps which are nicely spicy. Welsh rarebit as a savoury to finish is still one of my favourites - beautifully old-fashioned and spicy. <br /><br />A good wine list too and you don&#039;t have to spend a fortune (but you can if you like!). Their Picpoul de Pinet is a good choice with most white fish and shellfish<br /><br />We come here for the same reason that we go back time and again to the Colombe d&#039;Or in St Paul de Vence: it&#039;s not achingly hip or perfect modern cooking but it is good, reliable, luxurious with great service and is simply itself - a constant and comforting rock in a world of change.<br /><br />Our Italian (and there have always been a lot of excellent Italian waiters) waiter was superb and at the age of only 36 - born in the year I proposed which amused him (!) - he had skills and customer service that most restaurants would kill for.<br /><br />You will also see the occasional celeb which is nice: we have seen loads over the years (Jonathan Miller, Piers Brosnan, Helen Shapiro amongst many others. Katherine Ryan who is appearing in Glitter Room at the nearby Garrick has been recently and so will many other performers at local theatres like the Wyndham (opposite).

1928,85711,"Service was horrible - given we spend around GBP200 for a two person meal, would definitely not recommend - rather go to 28-50&#039;s Maddox Street restaurant. Table wasn&#039;t ready upon arrival despite reservation. Then our table was located in a place, where each time the entrance door was opened, cold air would stream directly at it (waiters didn&#039;t bother about making use of the curtain on the entrance door installed exactly for this purpose). Restaurant was further unusually loud as large group was poorly allocated creating significant noise in one part of the restaurant. Service then took 15min to notice us at our table once we were seated. We ordered cocktails as an aperitif, however they did not arrive until we were in the midst of our starters (with which we intended having wine). Once this delay became obvious, we wanted to cancel the cocktails and go ahead with wine order, however the waitress (who heavily struggled with her english) said this would not be possible as the cocktails were &quot;ready&quot; - they came 5 minutes later or so (please note this was maybe half an hour into the meal with still no drinks served). Our wine then also was delayed and arrived in the midst of our mains. As a cherry on the cake, when finally paying they didn&#039;t take Amex (despite having paid at the same place with Amex multiple times). The Marylebone restaurant always was a bit weaker than the one in Maddox street, however with this experience it has become unbearable. Don&#039;t get me wrong the food is great, which is why used to visit 28-50 so often, however this visit was so unpleasant that I definitely will not be visiting the Marylebone restaurant again.<br /><br />Would strongly recommend visiting 28-50 at Maddox Street (different owner, still founder-led/owned), a truly great place offering a significantly better experience as the staff is better trained and the vibes &amp; setting are nicer.",2,4.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2018-12-08

The service was pleasant enough but somewhat pressured. My guest had scarcely sat down before we were being asked to chose something to drink. We quickly decided on starters and mains and decided to have a little amuse bouche with a glass of wine. We had scarcely started our pre starter before the starters proper arrived and were unceremoniously plonked down on the (small) table. My guest&#039;s starter looked rather more exciting than mine and was, I gather, good. My starter which comprised smoked salmon and crab was fine … which was about as much enthusiasm as I can muster. Again in a frenzy our main courses arrived almost literally as we finished the last mouthful of our starters and again were plonked down. My slow cooked lamb with polenta was not good. The &quot;slow cooked&quot; lamb wasn&#039;t just pink but in places undercooked and very fatty. I don&#039;t know what had been done to the polenta but it just wasn&#039;t very nice. I should have sent it back. My guest&#039;s choice was again more successful than mine  but the rushed nature of the service and my frankly substandard main course spoilt the experience beyond repair. I would be sad if the Ivy group with its cafes had gone for volume throughput rather than guaranteed quality but that was the distinct impression on this visit. <br />Sadly, it would take a lot to persuade me to go back.",2,2.0,3.0,2.0,2.0,2016-03-02

2002,71284,"Visited the restaurant after reading good reviews but was pretty disappointed. Ordered starters and mains to all come at the same time and they arrived suspiciously quick (within a couples of minutes). Would be nice if they at least tried to pretend they cooked the food fresh. Restaurant wasn&#039;t that busy at the time so maybe that&#039;s the reason. Some dishes were verging on cold, especially the duck, although the taste and flavouring was really nice. For the price of the dishes I&#039;d have expected far better. Restaurant was also pretty cold in general and I&#039;m not usually bothered by cold temperatures. Service was good and staff were very polite and attentive. Food is the biggest let down for sure. Overall I wouldn&#039;t visit again as it wasn&#039;t worth the money.",3,2.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2018-09-15

2023,71284,The food at Patara is really good and it is a fantastically different menu from your average Thai. There are so many unusual and interesting dishes it is hard to chose! However it is not cheap but the atmosphere is cosy and it is not too fussy. But the waiters did get our orders wrong a couple of times so they could do with brushing up on this aspect a bit if they want to get away with charging the sort of prices they do. but all in all a really enjoyable evening with food that is pretty amazing.,4,5.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2009-09-28

This is a proper, old-fashioned (in the best sense of the word) French restaurant, with outstanding food in decent portions, an excellent wine list, polite, friendly and unobtrusive service and what would certainly be a wonderful ambience when full of happy diners.  Sadly, there were very few of there on a recent Friday evening, a consequence of current unhappy circumstances.  This did not detract however, from the excellence of the food and wine and the fine company of the charming owner and staff.  You feel welcome, pampered and extremely well fed after a visit here.  There is nothing trendy or &quot;woke&quot; about this place and it provides a haven from the madness out on our streets and in our confused and confusing daily lives, not to mention in our government.  Do go, enjoy the food and wine and feel nourished in more ways than one.  You can now go for breakfast or lunch if that is more to your taste than dinner.",5,5.0,3.0,5.0,4.0,2020-09-11

We always feel welcomed at S&amp;W. We ordered the Tomahawk Steak with lobster and our favourite mac n cheese and creamed spinach sides.

2040,107505,"We were seated at a table right by the toilets even though there were many others free and were the only people at our end of the restaurant.  My husband’s lobster starter was still slightly frozen.  The manager, who took our order forgot to put my husband’s main course through.  It was rushed through when she realised which was not until the other main courses arrived.  Consequently the steak which should have been marinated in a chimichurri sauce arrived with the sauce plonked on the top and overpowering with raw garlic and herbs. One of our drinks orders took over 20 minutes to arrive, and they made a mistake with one of the sides too.  Offered the cost of my husband’s steak off the bill.  Not a good experience when you are coming for a family birthday day out.  Should have been given the meal (or at least drinks) free as the whole experience was spoilt and service charge removed.  Compared to the branch we went to a couple of years ago in Miami which was faultless, this was nothing short of a disaster.",2,3.0,1.0,2.0,1.0,2019-12-27

We were greeted by a lovely waiter who arrived with complimentary sparkling wine from our hotel, who had suggested the restaurant.  We asked to sample the pea soup.  It seemed to be a difficult request. A manger had to be asked and eventually a sample arrived.  We both disliked this.  We decided to skip starters and order mains.  I had the cod and my plus 1 had lamb. We got 3 sides.  From sitting down to receiving our mains was 1 hours. This was way too long.  All our sides were only warm and simply too cool for eating. My cod was nice. The lamb was dry.  We advised the waiter. He has said that he had been so busy that he was unable to collect out food and said he would send his manger over.  The manager handled the matter very well.  She clearly understood that our experience had not been acceptable. Overall, I think this is a nice restaurant. I loved the decor and really thought the staff were excellent. However, I am not convinced based on the food we ordered and for me if the food isn’t hot, when it’s meant to be, then my meal has be ruined.

The chilli prawn and the scallop starters were an excellent start. All four of us went on to try different steaks and we all agreed the meat quality, preparation and presentation were 10 out of 10. My T-bone was one of the best if not the best I&#039;ve had. We went for the house white (Californian sauvignon blanc) and house red (Californian blend) wines. They were both outstanding and befitting the rest of the meal. At £80 a bottle the red is not inexpensive (there were lots of lower cost wines from around the World), but Smith &amp; Wollensky&#039;s house red is legendary and has been tried and enjoyed by this reviewer before in New York and Chicago. It simply goes perfectly with the steaks. Whilst we were discussing deserts, our water brought us a huge (and delicious) chocolate cake, complements of the restaurant, as a recognition of our three big dates. We washed this down with some recommended rum believe it or not. A first for all of us and it did go well. Throughout our occasion the service to our table was impeccable.

We ordered the pepper sauce too, which came separately, as we wanted to taste just the steak in its own juices first.

Their steak is perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and their service is a million times better than every other steakhouse in London. The ambiance and interior is just amazing, and you&#039;re never cramped for room. <br /><br />The location seems a little deserted right now, but apparently the Adelphi buildings are being redone into a mixed use development, so there&#039;ll be a lot more people in the area soon.

2087,138309,My friend and I were down from Scotland for a few days and chose Frog as we were seeing a show at The Savoy Theatre. We chose the Five course Tasting Menu and both agreed it was the best meal we had ever tasted. Each mouthful was a delight. The bread and pre dessert additional courses were a lovely surprise !! We were looked after very attentively and each dish explained very well - the little touches like providing a floor holder for our handbags all added to the experience.

The fish cake was light and incredibly tasty, the foie-gras terrine one of the best I have had in years, and so silky. my sister thought the beetroot and goats curd was excellent. Her main of Cottage Pie was beautifully presented but if I am honest, only average (we cook a much better one), but my pork steak was perfectly cooked, as were the accompanying vegetables, and we all adored the carrots. the linguini had a perfect egg, the truffle taste was excellent, but the pasta was too thin to be called linguini.

The hotel lobby was warm and comfortable, the restaurant was freezing and A/C needed adjusting, but was not done.  We dine out a lot and there are many restaurants in London that we will now prefer to go to. We are disappointed that the Savoy Grill did not live up to our expectations and our previous experiences.

Service was very attentive and the pace was exactly as we like it....fairly quick with starters and then a good gap between starters and mains and allowed to sit and relax as long as you want but never feeling like you have been forgotten. The waiters were friendly without being overly familiar but also not stuffy or haughty  (which can sometimes happen in expensive restaurants). They did run out of the foils gras and asparagus was off because end of season, but that just proves to me that they use fresh ingredients and when it is gone, it is gone......so no problem for me. We had the sweetbreads which were delicious and then  the Chateaubriand - the girls had the duck.  My husband chose a SA Chenin blanc which was reasonably priced and then we drank Gigondas with our main.......the wine menu offered value but also obviously you can go much more expensive, but what we had was good and not ridiculous money. The atmosphere was noisy and busy and fun, which meant we could all have a laugh and talk animatedly without feeling everyone was looking at us. The tables are set at a good distance from each other and we had one of the curved bench/banquettes along the edge so we had a nice view of the restaurant and could feel the atmosphere.  The restaurant had a good mix of modern and traditional......keeping the linen table cloths etc but modern feel in terms of flavours and atmosphere. <br />Of course it wasn&#039;t cheap....it&#039;s the Savoy and Gordon Ramsay!!!and London.........but for a special occasion (or if someone else is paying!) it is an excellent choice. They also made a little cake on a plate for my 18-year-old with a candle which was sweet. <br />We went to the Beaufort bar beforehand for a cocktail which was also lovely and overall had a very memorable evening. I probably wouldn&#039;t recommend it for a quiet romantic dinner for 2, but for parties of 4 or over and definitely for business dinners.....good choice.

My steak and ale pudding was excellent - tasty and light.  My dining companion had the chicken pie, which was equally good.  Service is friendly but not intrusive.

We had to let them know this and then wait another 3 minutes for the sauce. Then the steak was cold.<br />* I don&#039;t like that they have started with the self imlied tips so that when you get the bank terminal it is all ready added 12,5%. I had to tell the waitor about our experience and then I just gave 5%. That was actually 5% more then they should have had on this night, but we really like the place but it is not the first place we book on our next trip over unfortunately.",4,4.0,4.0,3.0,3.0,2015-02-20

The beef fat roast potatoes were really hard and tasteless with little potato in! You could actually hit them with a fork and they sounded hollow!<br /><br />The steak was average and the greens in garlic just seemed like strips of tasteless cabbage.

For Main, I chose the Sunday lunch &quot;from the trolley&quot; suggestion: Rump of beef, which was full of fat and that ruined it for me. Sides and desserts were delicious!

It offers simple classics, beautifully cooked in a buzzing and elegant setting, which still manages to retain privacy and comfort with circular tables and classic sofas.

The elderly couple next to us before even seeing the behaviour of our children summoned the maitre d over and made it obvious to us he was not happy and wished to be moved. This turned out to be wonderful as we could now relax with this couple gone. As usual the service is second to none, anything that could be done for us was. The wine was superb, and food even better.

The steaks were without a doubt the best I have ever eaten. Not cheap (at least in my eyes!) but worth every single penny. The wine was also superb, but perhaps not the best value (my wife&#039;s was £17 for a glass, and not a generous glass at that).

2214,105636,We had read all the media reviews of Portland and given that they are the recipient of one of Londons new Michelin stars we had high expectations.   We booked at Saturday lunch and ate from the A la Carte menu.  The food was good but did not reach greatness.   <br /><br />Snacks were interesting but the crab meat was swamped by the pickled kohlrabi  and one of the chicken skins was not crispy.  The starters (raw scallops and the hens egg &amp; autumn mushrooms were great but we both felt our mains (duck and pork neck) were a bit heavy handed and perhaps a little rustic.   Not really a criticism of the food per se but at over £30 for a main alone our expectations were very high.    <br /><br />Wine list is much more sensible than its contempories and one can drink well for £50 per bottle which is about the average price on the list.   <br /><br />In summary good food but not great value.  a two course lunch option for around £35 a head would have have left us feeling more positive about our experience.,4,4.0,4.0,5.0,3.0,2016-10-15

Luke warm, was swimming in a watered down cheap gravy &amp; looked like 3 wet pancakes. Tasted what can only be described as the inside of a Greggs corned beef pasty.

My Raspberry and Almond Tart with Mascarpone was very nice but fairly standard.  Our main issue was with the service. Our staff were helpful and obliging but underskilled, leaning across people to put cutlery and dishes down, slow to top up drinks, and the worst offence - carrying soup to the table with a thumb over the edge of the bowl, which seemed very amateurish.

The food took so long to come out (they give you a limit of an hour and a half there as soon as you are seated at your table to order, eat and then leave within that time frame), there were probably only about 6 other tables as well as ours and we was quite swift at ordering. The way that you order is relatively efficient as it is done on an interactive tablet, so you can call the waiter/waitress from the click of a button and they do arrive swiftly, but nothing can be done for how long it takes your food to arrive.  The interactive table was fun as you could play games to pass the time, but not all of the controllers worked properly. The place itself is very nicely decorated, and you do get service with a bit of a smile. It is very clean and they were quick seating us when we came through the door - no wait for that, but again it was not that busy. Service charge was automatically added onto the bill as expected in London, obviously we paid it as although we did not receive the best customer service, felt too awkward no to pay it. Normally we would of left a tip if the food didn&#039;t take so long, and if the waiters/waitresses were a bit more friendly; we felt a bit like we were bothering them when we asked for more water/drinks etc..",3,4.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,2019-04-10

The restaurant gave us a birthday promotion for which we received free drinks on arrival and a free dessert of our choice, which was brought in by the staff with sparklers. It was a magical night and we had so much fun with the interactive tables. Also I really like the fact that we can order through ipads and it had an image of the dishes next to it which made it a lot easier deciding what to buy. Additionally, it made calling the waiter a lot easier as you can press a button on the ipad to call them for the bill or for any other reason. <br />The only downside to the restaurant was that they have a £15 charge for bringing in birthday cakes which I think is unreasonable as most restaurants I&#039;ve been to in the past are okay with bringing cakes in.

The spicy aubergine is always terrific, baby crispy prawns are a personal favourite and the burgers were incredible too - which for a Asian restaurant is no mean feat. I love the new beef tataki and the spicy edamame was a treat. The negatives - I wasn&#039;t wowed by the chicken satay (which I normally am) and I think the hot stone ribeye was good, but our stone went cold quickly and it took quite a long time to bring a new one. However, the staff were lovely although they were busy getting to grips with the new technology. Inamo has changed from ordering through the tables to an tablet based system, and there are a few teething problems but nothing that can&#039;t be sorted during their soft launch period - and nothing that a few cocktails couldn&#039;t solve (although we did have to wait for one round of cocktails for what felt like quite a long time!).",5,5.0,5.0,4.0,5.0,2016-01-21

Unfortunately what let our experience down was some, not all of the food. Good chicken liver parfait starter and a very good cheeseplate and raspberry souffle.

We had to make the large waiter aware that we were ready to order, he took orders from other tables that arrived after us.  We then noticed that other tables received their food fairly quickly, yet ours took a good 20-25 minutes to arrive. My husband got through almost two pints of beer before our food arrived.  We thought this may have been because I ordered pasta, and perhaps this was made to order, but then another table ordered the same, and theirs arrived within 10 minutes of ordering.

2513,69655,"We come here fairly regularly and usually really enjoy the experience. The staff is generally very friendly and efficient without being overbearing. Last night was a different story. As we arrived, the waitress / hostess ignored us for a good five minutes, no eye contact, no acknowledgment that there were actually human beings waiting. Once we were seated, service seemed to be given begrudgingly and aloof. The goat&#039;s cheese salad (chef&#039;s special) appeared to have just been thrown on a plate. The steak was adequate but not up to their usual standard. We were made to feel more like an inconvenient nuisance rather than paying customers and the clearly insincere &#039; thank you and goodbye&#039; at the end of the evening added even more insult to injury. It&#039;s a real shame how one member of staff can ruin a restaurant&#039;s good name.

The £20 deal offered by OpenTable is no deal at all as the restaurant offers a 2 course menu for £17.95 which means that you pay £2.05 for the &#039;free&#039; cocktail.

Fairly limited but pleasing menu, we had various starters, all quite delicious followed by minute steak and frites. Only recommendation, as no veg, just a few salad leaves or small garnish of watercress as in France would have made the dish better presented. Steak was good however.

We wanted somewhere central as we all lived in different directions, with good food, good ambience but quiet enough to be able to catch up on a year&#039;s worth of gossip. So I booked a table upstairs hoping for some quiet.<br />When we arrived there was a wedding on, so was a bit worried about noise. The wedding party were being catered for upstairs so we were give a large table downstairs. However I needn&#039;t have worried about noise as the pub was lovely. There was no loud background music, just the gentle hum of subdued conversations.<br />The staff welcomed us like old friends. Drinks were brought to our table with a smile. We were encouraged to take our time ordering our meal, and given suggestions about menu items. Everything on the menu sounded fabulous, it was hard to choose.<br />I had the Sesame seared tuna...it was fantastic. Perfectly seasoned and &quot;cooked&quot;. Yum! My friends had the fish&amp; chips and Sea Trout. Both also perfection.<br />For dessert we had the chocolate fondant and sticky toffee pudding. I wished I didn&#039;t have to share my chocolate fondant it was sooo good! If in doubt about which dessert to have I would recommend the chocolate fondant. I don&#039;t normally do this, but had to send my compliments the Pedro the chef! I want to come back again and again to try all the other stuff on the menu<br />The wine list was ok too. A bit of everything to suit all tastes, but not so extensive to be baffling. You go to a pub you just want some good wine or beer to accompany your chat and meal. They have that here at the Footman.<br />Good location, great food, great staff, good drinks, reasonable prices. What more would you need.

I let them know in advance and all the staff couldn’t have been more pleasant and helpful on arrival and throughout the meal. So the staff were all wonderful. No complaints there. <br />Our sushi and pork cheek lollipop starters were wonderful as was the dry aged sirloin one of my sons ordered. However the rib eye was far too fatty and the chateaubriand which we ordered medium rare arrived chargrilled on the very outside but completely rare otherwise. It had far too much salt on the outer crust and seemed tough for a chateaubriand. It had been sliced in the kitchen and not at the table as is often done in other places so we didn’t want to send the whole thing back as we’d have all been eating at different times.  Disappointing for an £80 cut of beef and almost £400 meal for 2 kids and two adults. <br />The staff were great and brought my son a birthday brownie with a lovely message in chocolate writing. Only the food really let us down.

How wrong she was !<br /><br />When the taxi pulled up outside the maze grill, she nearly burst into tears as she had always wanted to eat at such a famous place. Needless to say, superb food and attentive staff just made the night unbeatable. My wife chose mussels and I chose chilli prawns for starters. Both tasted exquisite and there were plenty of each. We both had steak - i had a sirloin and my wife had rump, both were as good as any i have eaten in the USA. And the cool vibe and ambience made use feel welcomed and at ease. Excellent !!!!",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2014-01-03

Table was close to the door and a little small for the the party size bearing in mind i had booked for 6 people and there were only 5 of us on the day.<br />Starter and dessert were great but main course ribs i had were not well enough cooked and not up to standard.<br /><br />I might go back but overall was a bit of a let down for this group of ladies over from Belfast.,3,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2013-11-02

The Somlier was the nicest guy and very good at recommending wines that were in our budget.<br /><br />We had cocktails, steaks with sides, wine, pudding, dessert wine and it came to around £90 per person.<br /><br />We also sat in the bar afterwards and all in all it was a superb evening.

We had booked through Open Table yet there was no record of the booking - fortunately they weren&#039;t full.  There was no offer of drinks when we sat down and we had to ask to be served.  Generally, the service was awful. There was minimal crab in the crab starter and the fish was totally overcooked.  The potatoes that accompanied the fish were forgotten and we had to ask for the.  When asked if everything was alright we said it wasn&#039;t but no one came to ask what the problem was.  However, when we were paying the bill we were offered a 10% discount which we declined (we weren&#039;t complaining to get a price reduction).  We left without leaving a tip, never to return.

We ordered pasta, which arrived within very few minutes, so it must have been already prepared. The servings were quite large but nothing out of the ordinary and the prices were a bit steep too; £14 for a middle-of-the road pasta dish in a venue which is not particularly comfortable and with too many tables close together.

But I can not keep this place a secret.   <br /><br />These days thanks to a pandemic the best places need to be exalted, supported, and yelled from the mountaintops so they stay open.  <br /><br />First off this spot is tucked away in a very special part of Mayfair called Shepherds Market. L’Artiste Muscle is doing amazing food with amazing ambience. <br /><br />I personally go for the best mussels and fries in london. <br /><br />Hands down.  <br /><br />They remind me of the mussels I would get in the best parts of France and even at a special place called the Barnacle in Massachusetts.  If you know you know.  <br /><br />The fresh Mussels are bathed in a white wine cream  herb sauce and a full portion is close to God.  <br /><br />The staff are all amazing.  Habib, George, Sofia and chef, everyone here is friendly, the kind of friendly like you have known them for most of your life.  <br /><br />I haven’t tried digging deeper into the menu but the offer entrecôte steaks, duck, a lamb steak in garlic butter and rosemary, escargot,  chicken, and several fish options but I plan to once Im done eating through their amazing mussels.  But that Could take a while before I’m tired of them. <br /><br /> I will say they have a great selection of wines from white to red.  I suggest a Demi if your dining solo and they have specials. <br /><br />Starters l, I had the avocado, blue cheese, and Lardon salad and wow it was amazing. With crispy lardon was like gifts in every bite. <br /><br />Every time I here is hear tables next to me  saying “you gotta try this, it’s so good”.   <br /><br />So that’s a review in itself. <br /><br />They  also offer cheese plates and traditional French sides.  <br /><br />And when you done there are a couple of pubs on the corner to finish your night. <br /> <br />But you might just hang out and keep ordering wine.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2021-07-17

I ordered a starter and a main off the set menu ... a great value at GBP19, with the a la carte menu significantly steeper.  The service was pleasant and gracious.  One slight head-scratcher ... although the counter was empty when I arrived, they mysteriously seated me right in front of the wait staff service station where they all congregated.

But the dessert was a big disappointment. Billed as zabaglione mascarpone there was no evidence that it contained either egg yolks or Marsala. It was a long time since I had zabaglione in Italy so, although I questioned the waiter on the lack of Marsala, his reassurance left me in some doubt.

Cod/potatoes and samphire was ok - burrata with red peppers was average - not the best burrato. Overall we left feeling slightly disappointed.

Service appeared sporadic - it was good when it happened, but didn&#039;t seem to flow. Starters were both good - octopus and beef carpaccio. Main courses of mackerel and vongole were adequate.

The truffle arancini where good but had absolutely no truffles inside and the rice was too cooked. My beef cheek was very good, but the rabbit and wild boar pasta of my friends was dry and really average.

For example, the pork main course looked mean with just a few pieces of charred onion and apple matchsticks. The tiramisu dessert did not resemble nor taste like a tiramisu.

After 20 mins of being finished I asked someone nearby for the bill - which didn’t come. I then had to ask a further 2 times before someone even appeared with the bill - really dragging out our visit and making us irritable.<br /><br />We would visit again as we love exploring the decor.

Since I have a prawn allergy, they cooked my food separately in the kitchen, vs the communal cooking for everyone at the table.<br />Benihana waits for the whole table (8-9 places) to fill up before they start serving the food, so you may either have to wait a tad bit too long to get your food, or not have enough time for your  drinks &amp; starters before the food starts arriving.<br />That said, the food was delicious.",4,4.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2018-08-13

The deep-fried courgette flowers were very nice, as well as the fried calamari and prawns (very fresh) and the roast suckling pig (very tasty). However the roast potatoes that came with the suckling pig were vile (yes, I mean it). They were completely burnt and therefore inedible. As to the restaurant, it is quite outdated, with no vibe. It is also extremely noisy and expensive. £135 for two people. We only had a small starter, a small main and we shared the suckling pig with potatoes. No dessert. Wine: only a carafe of white wine shared by the two of us. I would recommend this restaurant for the food, but I find it too noisy and expensive, so no value for money.  The service was average. I also noticed that the restaurant manager was so focused on serving the people sitting in the table next to hours and totally ignored us. We were clearly not as important as them!

I would have expected more from the mussels (like in a deep plate with some of their cooking liquid, instead they were a bit dry) and the squids, which were nice but a bit burnt. The chili bruschetta with pork neck steak was very juicy and tasteful, so was the dessert &quot;le palle del nonno&quot;. I would definitely recommend it, even though the service was pretty average and the waiter was not really professional for the standard of the restaurant (serving men before women, serving wine in the wrong way and he did not recognize that the wine was corked).",4,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2014-07-27
3103,71677,I&#039;ve been coming to Boca di Lupo for several years now. The food is still very good but I think it&#039;s suffering a little from it&#039;s own success. The restaurant is always filled to absolute capacity and there&#039;s not quite enough room for all the waiting staff which means chairs are frequently knocked. Also the two hour dining window is just too short as main courses take a while to be served due to the sheer number of diners. As a result it often feels rather rushed.,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,4.0,2014-03-29

3105,71677,The food is generally always very good and sometimes outstanding . Service has been consistently bad on nearly every visit and occasionally like on this last visit some ingredients are not well sourced - in this case the Suckling Pig was of poor quality and almost tasteless despite the dish being perfectly executed.<br /><br />My first two choices of white wines were either not available because no cooled bottles were ready or out of stock. Italy has so many fine craft beer producers it is very sad to see &#039;Peroni and Moretti as the only choices on the menu.<br /><br />The weaknesses mentioned above are easy to correct.

3143,102477,"Afternoon Tea here was a real treat. The Oscar Wilde room has a real wow factor; it&#039;s well worth a visit for the decor, let alone the outstanding service and food.  Food was plentiful, with offers of seconds, and was thoughtfully tailored to our dietary needs, to the point of serving food separately to avoid cross-contamination.  Although advertised as a traditional tea there were special touches that set it apart, such as the amuse-bouche of a goats cheese muffin with a syringe of apple juice, and a palate cleanser of flavoured iced tea. The cakes were stunning, and the scones possibly the fluffiest and nicest we&#039;ve had.  Everything was fresh and beautifully presented. Service was kind, attentive and unrushed, and the music (live pianist) was pitched at the ideal background level to allow private conversation but not be too intrusive.  I would highly recommend this; it was excellent value and compares very well to the other top Afternoon Tea venues in London.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,2018-02-26

A series of poor service elements really detracted from the excellent food. From the lack of wine list when we were given the menus, to having to ask twice before it was brought over, to being told the champagne we wanted was not on the menu, and the under sommelier couldn&#039;t describe the replacement because he it had only just arrived that morning and he &quot;did not know the words in English&quot;.

Leave the wine selection to the sommelier, he knows his stuff.<br /><br />The whole experience is well crafted and the service is impeccable - no one looms near your table, but your glass and plates are never left empty.

Food is always first class (as you would expect from a One Star establishment earned in the first 10 months) and the second star can&#039;t be far away.<br /><br />The Truffle Risotto is equisite with brown butter and the Crispy Piglet is melt in the mouth with a herb crackling.

3216,75727,"The portion of food (both had cod) relative to its cost, was way off the mark. Good thing I had a light meal before going (mum&#039;s advice to always eat something just in case) else, I&#039;d have starved all evening. Noticing each meal was over £35, we turned down the offer of a selection of sides at an extra cost as we assumed the meals would be of a good size portion.<br /><br />I wished we hadn&#039;t after noticing the serving an amazingly well presented snack size cod on the plates and we&#039;d have made both disappear in about 4 mouthfuls. I opted for the “eat as slow as possible” technique to make the special dining moment last a little longer.<br /><br />It was a tasty cod and well-presented but only good for a bar snack not a meal. Steak next time.<br /><br />The music was chilled during dinner as expected but when the full band came on, it became a real full on party exactly what we wanted. Great music new and old which made every one jump on their feet, sing along and shake what they were given. The DJ added to the same fun when it was his turn.

Three mixed sandwiches arrived but we then asked another waiter who said there would be no problem in doing a veggie option of egg, avocado cheese and cucumber.

My colleague with me had a rib eye and other than marbling of fat she had nothing like my ‘sirloin’.  The server told me that some sirloins were very fatty and I responded that had I known this then I would not have selected this particular cut.

My husband had oysters, which were fine, but then again it&#039;s not like you have to do anything apart from open them, it&#039;s hardly cooking. The menu waxed lyrical about Chateaubriand but even at 6.30pm on a Friday evening they had already run out of pieces small enough for 2 people - they recommended 600g but had nothing smaller than 750g and at £12+ per 100g, that&#039;s a pricey steak! The fillet we ordered was good, but so it should be for the price. If i were going to spend that money on steak again i&#039;d go to Gaucho&#039;s. At least they give you a little basket of fancy bread!",3,3.0,3.0,3.0,2.0,2012-09-28

Wonderful cocktails and superbly matched wine choices. So glad we didn&#039;t eat starters; the chateaubriand with chips and creamed spinach hit the spot and left us so full!

I asked for no onion, without realising that the fried onion does most of the heavy lifting in terms of appearance, so it came out looking very little and flat. If you didn’t think of the truffle, you’d say it was a pretty good burger.<br /><br />Chips tasted good, but came out slightly on the cool side and therefore a bit rubbery. We also got croquetas, which were fried perfectly.<br /><br />It was hardest to peg in terms of value. If it had tasted of truffle, and the chips crispy, it would have been absolutely phenomenal value. But for a standard, small burger… let’s put it this way, my dining companion said “I could’ve gone to McDonald’s for a fraction of this amount”. And truthfully, you can get consistently excellent standard burgers and fries at Honest for the same price.<br /><br />Service was good though - friendly, attentive staff.

3621,144192,Door lady sat us away from the main eating area and right next to the ugly kitchen even though the resteraunt was practically empty where it looked nice(dont know what her problem was). Food was overpriced and the quality of the food didnt justify the spend. Dont get the noodles #nasty. Prawns were nice and serving staff were polite and entertaining. Wouldnt go again.

3625,144192,"Snugly located in the narrower streets off Leicester Square my friend was a bit hesitant. Our uncertainty changed into ecstasy once we passed the door and into the restaurant. The place was humming with activity and looked a lot more spacious than the impression you get from outside.<br /><br />At about 2pm on a weekday it was not very busy and we had no problem in getting a table.<br /><br />To me PF Chang is like a treasure trove. Each time you visit there is another new item you want to taste. This time was no different. I started off with my regular, tried and tested vegetable spring roles followed by the must have PF Chang&#039;s signature dish the Dynamite Shrimps. A dish that to me has set a bench mark for what a shrimp/ prawn dish should be like. Most other tables had it!<br /><br />We followed it with a lettuce Chicken wrap. Another usual for me.<br /><br />This time I noticed a very enticing dish being served at another table. My waiter informed me it was &#039;chicken Deli&#039; Looked very inviting on its own but was served with white creamy rice. It was simply out of this world. Try it next time you visit PF Chang.<br /><br />Of course NOT everything was perfect. The waiters, service, ambience and most importantly the food were great but......Definitely rather expensive. I was glad I only hand one guest. More than that, I would have ended up washing dishes to pay my bill!",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,2.0,2019-10-21

3705,4275,They were great there and looked after us but unfortunately our day didn&#039;t go according to plan as we were put close to the door. I wouldn&#039;t have minded spending the amount of money I did if I sat where it was advertised and where I thought we&#039;d be but sitting by the door spoilt what should have been a fantastic occasion. Great restaurant but feel cheated as it was both mine and my wife&#039;s birthday as well as our 21st wedding anniversary. We were so looking forward to sitting in the side of the restaurant which received the award of most romantic restaurant 2015 but unfortunately this did not happen even though I asked and could see there was space.,4,4.0,3.0,4.0,3.0,2015-08-30

My only complaint is that the upstairs room we were in didn&#039;t feel like part of the restaurant and didn&#039;t have much of an atmosphere as only 2 other tables were taken. So I don&#039;t feel that we got the full restaurant experience. But I did only book a month ago so was happy to get a table. Service and food were great.

It started well with some amazing yucca crisps with a home made salsa which was exquisite and mopped up so fast that theAn octopus tiradito dish with a very light tapenade style olive flavouring was exquisite - and my guest, who had generally steered well clear of octopus throughout their life was persuaded to indulge and persuaded to change their mind.  The sea bream ceviche was also top notch.  Other stand outs were the beef loin anticucho, squid jalea and a decent mixed tempura.

3790,70195,"We&#039;ve not ticked the above question as to whether we would recommend the tea to friends as we had mixed reviews. Whilst the waiters were very pleasant, there were a few disappointments as below;<br /><br />- Upon sitting at the table, a couple of the chairs were dirty with crumbs from previous sittings which we had to clean off the seat ourselves!<br />- Whilst the tea is described as being Christmas festive, there isn&#039;t much festivity in the food. A couple of small cakes but this was it along with the pianist playing a couple of carols. Yet, we paid more for a &quot;festive&quot; tea, it did not feel festive!<br />- Considering it was Christmas, I was surprised there were no Christmas decorations in the tea room which was disappointing as we were hoping to see some.<br />- The waiters were pleasant and upon knowing it was my parent&#039;s anniversary, they provided a personalised cake to them which was very sweet.<br />Overall, I feel we paid a lot of money (GBP100 per person) and yet I really do not feel it was worth that much. It felt very much like a money making machine (which it is), whereby you are cramming tables in on a factory line, getting the money and then that is it and having been wanting to do a tea for several years, we were left slightly disappointed. <br /><br />However, thankfully my parents enjoyed it which was key given it was for their anniversary and I hope this feedback helps for you to improve the experience for future customers.",3,4.0,3.0,4.0,2.0,2019-12-18

I requested a nice table, so they gave us a table in the pagoda in the middle of the room. From start to finish, everything was wonderful. The sandwiches were some of the tastiest I have had in an afternoon tea - they were also halal, which was wonderful. The scones, the pastries, the teas, everything was just perfect. The service, which I had been told was hit and miss, was actually lovely. Every waiter could not do enough for us. Even when I asked a waiter to take a few pics of my friend and I, he actually suggested us taking pics in an alternative part of the hotel and kindly accompanied us to take our pics there.

We opted for the 3 course market menu experience which comes in at £25 per head with a glass of champagne or wine. The options were limited for each course but good quality (pork, fresh mackerel). We didn&#039;t understand combining a creamy risotto with mackerel for one of the mains - it didn&#039;t quite work.

The food, wine and service was excellent and the deal (2 courses for £15.99) completely transparent. The wine is expensive but they do a deal inclusive of wine if you want that, we wanted to treat ourselves.

I skipped dessert as I had my eye on the enormous cheese board with cheeses that could practically walk themselves to your table. Fantastic. Excellent wine list - French, of course. Good and efficient service.

The ceviche dishes were second to none - and we have eaten a lot of ceviche!  We were also very impressed with the grilled items coming off the charcoal barbecue - the spicy beef fillet was bordering on tartare and just melted in the mouth and the broccoli took on the smoky flavours of the coals and raised broccoli to another level.  We were convinced that nothing could beat the beef fillet - until we tried the sea bass.  It was slightly caramelised and hands down some of the best sea bass I have ever had.  Dessert was a pure indulgence with chocolate and passion fruit options on the same plate.

Not quite with a gun at their heads but not far behind! There was no mention of the 2 hour window on booking or on reconfirming my reservation. The service was rushed and the wrong side of efficient i.e. rude.<br /><br />Restaurants who treat paying customers like this do not deserve their success. But Coya was packed with young things paying handsomely for their dates. My friends well have the means to eat in Coya every night if they so wish but I doing that they will after this experience.

We ordered the tasting menu with the prestige wine pairing and my party of three was unanimous that everything was excellent - not a single misstep.  I rarely give 5 star ratings on here but the night I was there I just could not find a fault with this restaurant, probably my best dining experience this year so far.  I will say that the service is more towards the formal end of the spectrum rather than casual but it&#039;s not stuffy or pretentious; more of a Gallic precision and correctness while still understanding that the customer comes first.

4115,100362,"I honestly was so excited to come here because looking at the food / drinks menu on site it sounded amazing arrived 10 minutes before and had to wait but that was fine as we were still sat 5 minutes before our booking but after that it went completely downhill. First round of drinks came missing 1 drink. then we order food and got told there was no chicken so we had to order something else. Then we order another round of drinks and we’re missing 2 drinks we then waited 20 minutes for 1 of the drinks and then another 5 minutes for another drink. When our starters were brought to the table we were then told that one of the starters we had ordered they didn’t have so we were sat there with 3 out of 4 starters. Then once we had finished starters nothing was cleared the mains were brought out and just dropped on the table we ordered 2 of the mains with normal chips and one with cheesy chips. When the mains were delivered 2 came with sweet potatoes and one came without any potatoes at all nothing was mentioned or discussed with us. When we questioned the waiter he said it’s because they had run out of chips so instead of discussing it with us they just decided to just change it themselves but the chefs forgot 1 portion. These sweet pots were cold but after all this I couldn’t be bothered to mention any more. And then we tried to order another round of drinks and both cocktails we tried to order yet again they didn’t have. At this point even the server was embarrassed, I work in the hospitality industries and know the struggles of supply chains but the service and communication with the table was horrendous. I would like to speak to someone to discuss a part refund I understand not giving a full refund but i would like some sort of gesture of good will for this terrible experience we had.

4149,100362,"I have previously been to the Chelsea location and was much more impressed then. This time I paid around £20 for lobster mac and cheese, a side salad and a pina colada daiquri. The food arrived before the drinks- not a great start- and I counted 3 small pieces of lobster in my mac and cheese- much less than what I would have got had I ordered the other lobster dishes (all at the same price). Considering how cheap and easy it is to make mac and cheese I don&#039;t think they should be skimping on the lobster. My side salad was barely a salad- limp lettuce and 2 cherry tomatoes. Does that count as a salad? My drink, when it arrived, barely tasted of anything close to a pina colada- strong, unidentifiable alcohol was the prominent flavour. My companions had the BBQ plates which, while offering more food, didn&#039;t resemble the quality found in other BBQ restaurants at similar price points. There are a lot of BBQ restaurants in London at the moment, which means more choice. At this point in time I think I&#039;ll have to scratch Big Easy off my list, their central location has ruined their food and turned it into a tourist trap where food doesn&#039;t match the price.

4189,69685,"I have to be honest, I had much higher expectations due to the pricing and having seen it in Time Out. <br />I went there for an anniversary and knew we&#039;d be spending much but here goes the experience: <br />We ordered two starters, fried calamari and a squid salad. Both were relatively small amounts but nothing super irrational, apart from the fact that there was very few pieces of squid in the salad and the calamari was made up of the batter mainly. Can&#039;t say I disliked it but wasn&#039;t blown away either. A waitress who we later found out was new, took away one of them before we were done and had said so twice...<br />I think we got some noodles too which were decent and shareable. <br />We also got spicy pork belly and prawns. The pork belly was actually great and skimpy in amount. Not super spicy either, which is not a problem just something to note if you&#039;re looking for major heat. The prawns arrived last, which was a bit strange considering everyone else was getting all the food at the same time and lets be honest, its not like they have to cook it first... So those prawns cost about £13 they came with no sauce on them and theres literally just 5, which makes it impossible to split (since most tables are for 2 people) also 5 prawns, really??? They should at least mention piece amounts for the BBQ stuff...<br />Lastly the same new waitress went to offer us desert but then came back to apologise because she didn&#039;t know the kitchen was closing as I was about to order something. <br />So, considering there is also around £8 service charge, I can&#039;t say I left happy. <br />Don&#039;t get me wrong, I know a lot of restaurants with high prices/small portions but since in most cases they live up to great quality food and good service this was a pretty sad hit and miss.",2,2.0,3.0,1.0,1.0,2017-11-26

We were given the wine list and a Bellini each and assumed that as soon as they have a table available they would move us to the window, which was within 10 minutes. Our wine glass was never more than a quarter full, and we were treated like royalty. They remembered throughout I was gluten free and made sure to tell me about the menu before I had a chance to ask.

The fish main course was very delicious and well presetned as well, just that there wasn&#039;t enough sauce added to the dish, so it dried up before the fish was finished.

4278,128691,"I booked for a birthday party if two, staff upon arrival asked for my voucher and took it, we were ushered to a congested table despite lots of vacancies and i specifically asked for a separate table far from crowd due to compromised immune system but when i asked the waiter responded, “does it matter” they have forgotten that we are still having a pandemic! The restaurant was Not full.lots of free table and numerous staff who seemed unsure and confused.I arrived 10 minutes before my booking but my order arrived 1 hour after. When i asked what on the menu, the rather sweet waitress said, she will come back cause she was new to the restaurant but she was apologetic. When i asked for the bill, i was given and charged for the afternoon tea and Only corrected when i said, i had a voucher, why it wasn’t deducted. the tea service was rusted and i need to point it to the lady serving. She came back with numerous choices around 5x uncleaned tea strainers saying the stain doesn’t go away but after i asked for top up she came back with a polished one and she pointed it up to me that “Now, its cleaned and polished “🤪i have tea service and strainers at home so I know it can be cleaned if done properly. It was awkward and unpleasant experience, food was mediocre, nothing special. In my reservation, i asked for no mayonnaise because of allergies but they didn’t bothered checking., i have to asked many times which ones has mayonnaise on it, overall, nit very impressed, food could be good but service was very substandard. I dont think i shall recommend it to my friends who are regular afternoon tea goers.

But a good test of a restaurant is how they deal with any problem, and the restaurant came up trumps.  Offers of re-cooking food declined as we were half way through already; pleasant and genuine apologies offered.  And then offending item subtracted from bill.  As a result, we will definitely return and also recommend this place: mistakes happen, and these were dealt with well.  Other food offerings excellent.  Staff charming.",4,2.0,4.0,5.0,5.0,2017-11-28

We went there on a Saturday for a pre-theatre meal because it&#039;s a stone&#039;s throw from the theatre and they offer a competitively-priced prix fixe menu (3 choices for main course). However, they were overwhelmed with business, with the result that service was very slow and in fact we didn&#039;t have time for our second course. Constantly looking at one&#039;s watch doesn&#039;t make for a relaxed dinner. When it did come, the food was OK but not much more than that.

The service was very good and dietary requirements were accommodated for. The set up to stop drinks falling over and cutlery rolling away is very impressive. The route through London was thoroughly enjoyable. Some of the flavours/combinations on the menu were unusual but the quality of the food and overall menu was very good, especially considering it is prepared in a moving kitchen. This is not a cheap night out, however it is also not your average eating experience and I would go again and recommend it.

I was most impressed by the delicious scones, but the sweets were amazing too - passionfruit cheesecake was refreshing, raspberry macaron was too pretty to eat, the bitterness of matcha cake was perfect to balance the sweetness and the opera cake was to die for, we finished the sweets in one bite!

A first look at the restaurant with 3 garbage bags bang outside the so called fine dining restaurant spoilt the image for us. Once inside,  the place was quite small, though ambience was ok. The food was of mixed quality. The chicken starter and galouti kebab were good but the vegetarian dahi bhalla starter was disappointing with the bhalla being hard and probably not fresh. The curry portions in the mains were ridiculously small and in general portion sizes were smaller than average given that the restaurant is not cheap. Food overall was ok but nothing exceptional. Our bill was messed up with the waitress charging wrong amount on card which then had to be corrected.

Hardly an issue but not what you&#039;d expect at Browns in St Martin&#039;s Lane. We then waited for 15 minutes before even being offered a copy of the menu - they were tidying up after the pre-theatre rush apparently. Good food (apart from a derisory &#039;side salad&#039; consisting of some huge slices of tasteless tomato and some sad looking leaves); the fish pie was terrific. My chocolate bomb sadly didn&#039;t melt when the sauce was poured on it - rather spoiled the &#039;theatre&#039; of the dish, but it tasted delicious. Overall, rather pricey for what was an average meal out and a disappointment considering we were celebrating ten years since our first dinner date at the very venue (and we both remembered it being considerably better in 2008!).",3,4.0,3.0,2.0,3.0,2018-11-07

All the adaptations we did ask for came as requested, and the hot chocolate was fantastic.

My friend ordered the pork belly mac and cheese and it was not anything like she expected either.<br /><br />Service was also pretty bad - felt like we were interrupting the bar staff to order food, and the food took a long time to come.<br /><br />I used a taste card, so it was 50% off, but even with such a massive discount, I can’t say the food was worth the price we paid.

We basically had ice-cream shavings on a plate with a garnish - totally not worth the money or the wait and we got the impression they&#039;d forgotten about the order and then put it together in a hurry.

Secondly, I was seated in the worst possible table next to kitchen even though there were other tables available as I decided not to go with the Valentine’s set menu. Thirdly, the most disappointing of all, my wife was served a dish with meat when we had specifically ordered for a vegetarian dish. We had double checked with the waitress while placing the order, but they still messed up the order. My wife had never eaten meat in her life, but took a bite from the meal she got served. That ruined the evening for us. <br /><br />To top it all off, the drinks order was messed up too and we were served the wrong drinks. When they did serve the daiquiri that I had ordered, it was the worst I’ve had in my life. It was nothing but juice + rum served in a glass meant for drinking water.

4455,99030,"It&#039;s been a year or so since my last visit to Murano and I&#039;m sad to say that the restaurant has gone badly downhill since then.  Difficult to see how it now merits a Michelin star.  <br /><br />Problems start with the menu, which has to be explained to you.  Five sections, with four dishes per section, and you choose anything you like, in any order, and portion sizes will be adjusted (apparently).  What&#039;s the point?  <br /><br />Then there&#039;s the food, relatively small portions of very ordinary fair, lacking any clear connection to Italy.  My beef fillet could not have been more than 100gm, rather greasy (soue vide?) and lacking any originality.  You would be better off going to a place like Picture for comparable food at less than half the price.  <br /><br />The wine list is full of wines I&#039;ve never heard of, with little under £60 per bottle, making it difficult to do anything other than guess or take advice. <br /><br />Finally the service is intrusive, the waiting staff interrupting conversation at the table, rather obviously wanting to move things along quickly.<br /><br />My advice: revert to a conventional, Italian style menu; reduce the number of dishes on offer and make then worth eating; train the staff to &quot;wait&quot; at table and sack the wine buyer.",2,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,2017-04-22

I must admit that I was not hugely convinced by the menu, but thought that it&#039;d be good to try a new destination.<br /><br />Oh how right I was - service was attentive but not overbearing, or stuffy, atmosphere was relaxed, dining room was full but tables are well-spaced to ensure privacy, sommeliers knew their stuff, food was gorgeous and the freebies at either end of the meal were of great quality. That coppa- wow!<br /><br />Favourite bit? When the waitress brought me some more of the top-notch bread to mop up the sauces on my near-empty plate of lamb neck and then explained that the Italians have a word for that (I forgot what it is, but shall be looking it up!).<br /><br />£33 plus service per cover for 3 excellent courses is a bargain.

Superb prosciutto and bread as amuse-guele and very generous portion. Panna Cotta dessert was brilliant and perfectly balanced. Even made up a birthday dessert surprise - very slick.

It lacked ambiance, which in part may have been because it was lunchtime, but the decor felt quite late 80&#039;s business lunch rather than the decadent look I assume they were trying to achieve.Certainly I didn&#039;t feel it matched the style of food being served.

Jason Atherton was busy cooking at the chef’s table and all the staff were welcoming, friendly and professional. The new 4 course menu concept was superb in every way and the addition of canapés and other treats between courses were delicious and creative.

There was no attentiveness or warmth from our waiter, who although visibly busy, did not take any time to explain the dishes, and put the plates and cutlery down with force and at one point I had to stop a knife rolling off the table.  A smashed wine glass (it happens), and too many dessert courses on the tasting (4 in total with petit fours), where an additional savoury dish would have been warranted, left us feeling underwhelmed.

Favourite this time was the scallops with jalapeño granita (cool and refreshing with just the right amount of heat at the end) we chose the tasting menu which was kindly adapted to suit pescatarian diet.  Each course was delicious and you really should try the oyster ice cream (even if you don’t like oysters) it delivers a true taste of the sea.  The team at Pollen Street are professional and discrete but also delivered a really fun evening - interacting with us and sharing some laughter where appropriate.  They are extremely knowledgeable about the food and always ready to answer questions.  The sommelier was an absolute star - happily guiding our wine choice around price point and tastes.

4606,94350,"I had high expectations, having been to Maze when Jason Atherton was head chef there. My expectations weren&#039;t met. It wasn&#039;t terrible, but wasn&#039;t great either, to be honest.<br /><br />Our table was booked for 9.30pm, which was quite late, of course. Despite that, we didn&#039;t get to our table until closer to 10pm, which wasn&#039;t a big issue, but I expected a bit more attention from the waiting staff as a result, perhaps.<br /><br />We ordered two bottles of wine to go with the 9 course tasting menu. The first was white and I said to the wine waiter that we&#039;d drink that with the first part of the menu as it was mostly fish. I wanted to move on to the red when the meat courses started arriving. Despite this, our glasses were not refilled very often and I even had to ask for a passing waitress to find my wine for me - which, of course, wasn&#039;t on my table, so we couldn&#039;t help ourselves.<br /><br />The food was ok, but again didn&#039;t meet our high expectations. Something called fish and chips was a fishy tasting mouse inside a puffed up bit of potato starch. It looked impressive and different, but didn&#039;t taste great and the puffed up potato starch stuck to my teeth.<br /><br />The lamb dish was was really good. The rabbit was good too. Some of the fish dishes were not really my thing, but were ok. We enjoyed the ice cream course which was a number of blobs of ice cream presented in a box with lids and you had to guess the flavour. That was fun and the flavours were very nice.<br /><br />Finally, the restaurant was very noisy. We couldn&#039;t hold a conversation without leaning in constantly.<br /><br />I&#039;d like to visit again one day, but perhaps in a different season.",4,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2017-04-22

4609,94350,They tried to redeem themselves when clear going off the the rails. Beef spectacular but initial service bad - 30 minutes wait for a drink and to give order. My husband&#039;s lamb was indifferent and the replacement fish dish was so salty it was virtually inedible.

Filet very good, pigeon very good, but neither that much more special than what you can get for almost half the price at places like Hereford Road (etc) for a bit less ambience.

It also has a very well stocked bar for pre/post dinner drinks, including a good cocktail menu!<br />The only negative I would point out from this visit was the service which didn&#039;t seem up to their usual standard.

The bar downstairs was also a great experience, it had a really nice vibe and was quirky, serving  great cocktails.

The dishes followed one another in a bit too rapid of a tempo, as if the waiters were instructed to get everyone seated and out again within a strict time frame.

The situation was well-retrieved (and we didn&#039;t have to pay for our drinks, which was kind) but it set an apologetic tone that altered the staff/customer relationship. Just a Christmas glitch, hopefully.<br /><br />That said, the food was - as ever - quite excellent.  Delicate flavours, not too much nor too little, served in an order determined by the knowledgable waiter, no rush; lovely.  The sea bream, twice-roasted chicken, the mix of beans, augerbines, all spectacular!

4734,57952,"We have been to Nopi a few times and have always had a great time. The food is incredible so we were looking forward to another Ottolenghi experience BUT..... the music was completely inappropriate to the ambience. It would have been fine if we were heading off afterwards to a club but looking around at the demographic I cant imagine anyone would have been checking out the nearest hotspot. Then the service was officious, totally impersonal and it seemed they couldn&#039;t wait until we had put our forks down for them to whip away our plates - no such opportunity to mop up the last bits of amazingness with your bread!!

4736,57952,Only disappointing thing about our experience at NOPI was expecting a pre-theatre dinner and being told they don&#039;t do them on a Saturday. In all honesty though this did us a favour as my boyfriend and I were able to try more dishes and it was definitely worth the additional cost. I didn&#039;t expect the food to be as good as it was so it was a really nice surprise. The dinner was not cheap but I don&#039;t mind paying more for a good quality dinner.<br /><br />The service was good and as I have a nut allergy the waitress was brilliant at checking with the chefs.<br /><br />All in all I would recommend this restaurant!,4,5.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,2013-12-21

4739,57952,"I was looking forward to taking my wife to NOPI, having heard so much about Ottolenghi. The food and wine were very good as we expected, but we were let down by poor service. After our waitress took our desert order she simply vanished, and we were left waiting for over half an hour before I was able to request the bill from her. Even at this stage she was rather sluggish in making this happen. I should add that the restaurant at this stage (10.30pm on Saturday) was by no means full. As we had another engagement to attend we were left rather frustrated by this holdup at the end of the meal.

It is noisy because of all the hard surfaces and the &#039;ladies&#039; is just bizarre... what ever happened to function over form in design?

We ate upstairs but I&#039;ll be back in a group to dine round the big tables downstairs in view of the kitchen.

4762,60973,"We (Dutch and food lovers) were visiting London for a long weekend and were lucky to book a table downstairs at 6 p.m. on a saturday night. So we were permitted to stay till 8. <br />we started with a glas of champagne and a nice conversation with our neighbour guests, but were several times interupted by the (friendly) waitress for ordering our meals. We took about 3 to be shared dishes pro person and two starters. These starters were already taken away before we were able to finish it, and as it was very nice, we kindly asked to leave it on the table.<br />After 10 minutes or so everything was served all in one time exept for out meat, which was served 10 minutes after our first dish.  WIthin  35 minutes after arriving  everyting was finished exept for our deserts. As we like to enjoy our meals and conversations we asked if we could wait ordering our deserts which was said to be no problem, but after another 10 minutes we had all the stuff on the table again.  In about 1,5 hour we were outside again, feeling that there was a constant rush in eating and ordering. The food was really good, but as we like to take our time for it I doubt if we ever come back here. It felt more like a tapas bar than a restaurant.

This is unacceptable. We came out for dinner with friends ahead of Christmas and we ended up with only the option of ordering sandwiches. <br /><br />As there was a limited number of staff (who often stood nearby texting on their phones or chatting instead of taking orders or bringing cutlery, sauces, food...) we had to wait a long time for our order to be taken, a long time for the food to arrive, and we had no other table service other than this - nothing. <br /><br />One person in our group received their food after everyone else had finished, despite us ordering sandwiches and having chased the staff numerous times. When it arrived the order was incorrect and missing key ingredients as listed for the item on the menu.

Completely inappropriate. <br /><br />As we left we discovered that the least helpful and rudest waitress was in fact the &quot;manager&quot;. She approached us to say we could have a free bottle of prosecco next time we visited. I won&#039;t be going back, but even if we did, they&#039;ll never fulfil this offer on a say so.

The toast for the &#039;unlimited&#039; sandwiches was so dry. Though I would say they really did put some thought into the fillings. Was creative. Then, let&#039;s talk about pastries. Terrible colors was used due to the &#039;holiday theme&#039;. Weird green frosting to represent a Christmas tree, and weird hot pink to decorate the cherry. The texture of it wasn&#039;t even close to what I pay for. The scones were amazing. Enjoy them while hot. Scones were probably the highlight of the entire set. <br /><br />Overall, the value is pretty low but the experience was worthwhile. It really depends on what you&#039;re looking for I guess.

All started very well with great service and some fastastic oysters (some of the best we have had), but the quality of the rest of the meal was a little mixed: the roast boar was cold, some of the meat on the mixed grill overdone and seasoning issues on other items. It didn&#039;t quite ruin our night but it was disappointing considering the reputation of the restaurant. It was then topped off with a slight disagreement over a bottle of red wine, which was attempted to be served chilled...which we didn&#039;t appreciate and sent back.

4895,40281,"I reserved a table at Yuu Kitchen on Saturday 19 October, for my wife’s birthday.  We attended the restaurant with our 5yo and 2yo children. <br /><br />The concept sounded exciting to us: Taiwanese/ Asian cuisine situated next to an Ice Bar where you can take the kids for some fun afterwards, we were let down by the quality of food and service.  <br /><br />Here’s the summary: <br /><br />- there is no children’s menu and the adult menu is limited for choice. I would NOT recommend this place for families with young children.<br /><br />- service was extremely slow. The restaurant was not particularly busy - despite being a Saturday afternoon - but everything from ordering food, drinks and even the bill - which we had to request three times - was a drag. <br /><br /> - food is a mediocre. The bao buns seemed stale and stodgy, and the rice was extremely dry. Plain rice is a winner with kids generally, but we all were unable to finish even the small bowl that was served to us. <br /><br />- the icing on the cake was that, despite the restaurant being listed on TasteCard with a “50% off” offer, the restaurant claimed this was an error but agreed to give us a 25% discount as a gesture of goodwill.  Five days later, it still appears on Tastecard....<br /><br />In summary, the concept and location has huge potential but falls short of good service and food: bare minimum expectations for a mid-market restaurant in central London.",2,3.0,3.0,1.0,5.0,2019-10-19

This didn&#039;t affect the bottle we opened however.<br /><br />My real issue is with their business practices. An &quot;optional&quot; 12,5% service charge was added to my bill without informing me or asking my permission. The bill arrived wrapped around their business card with the lettering on the inside. Not ever before having had an &quot;optional&quot; charge added without being asked about this I paid without questions. I only found out about this once I arranged my things at home. <br /><br />I emailed the restaurant about this but haven&#039;t yet had a reply.

He brought the bill right away and when I told him I wanted to take the optional service charge off the bill, corrected it right away.

This was incredibly off putting.  I realise that things like this happen but, although, the staff were apologetic, I was given a replacement coffee which I then still had to pay for. I think that good customer service would have taken the coffee off the bill or would have at least offered to do so.

After the sushi came 45 min late I told him to cancel it and he argued that it’s been ordered and would not. Later he came back and said he took it off the bill, but it was still there.

I am half Peruvian so I can say that the flavouring was authentic (though milder in terms of spiciness). We were are very satisfied after sharing these dishes. Though our table was only booked for 2 hour we were not rushed at all and encouraged to continue ordering.

Past menus included lobster bisque, burratina, braised lamb and lovely tatins and tarts for dessert. Sadly I can&#039;t say that either I or my partner were as excited about the current menu.

Selecting them from a stand is half the fun. The scones were the best I’ve ever had, buttery but light and exactly the treat they should be. <br />The sweet treats again came out plated up not ready to select at will, and we’re just a bit ‘meh’. They were tasty but not inspiring or provocative, and after seeing Cherish in action on tv I just felt like something was missing. For a solidly traditional afternoon tea I would choose the ritz or actually the lanesborough was excellent, but this just made me a little sad.<br />FINALLY - and this is an issue, the tables!

The cakes were tiny and very sweet, we couldn&#039;t even eat the lollipop one it was pure sugar, although the scones were lovely.

Due to time of year there were some large groups on Xmas celebrations so the noise factor certainly impacted and made it impossible to have a conversation across the table with each other. Our request to have our dessert served upstairs at the bar was quickly actioned and we moved to a quieter area. The customer service from Sangram the restaurant manager was superb and he went out of his way to make sure we were happy and looked after and apologised for the noise of the group originally next to us.

However, it took 15 minutes before we were offered drinks which I do not think is acceptable.  Also we had booked to take advantage of the special offer menu but when we were seated, we were not offered this menu choice and had to ask for it.

You’re treated like royalty and the staff are just as passionate about the food as you are. Styled in an Art Deco fashion, it’s incredibly comfortable, stylish and up market. The wine list is very well sourced and even better priced. <br /><br />The food: OMG! In a word (2 words) - perfectly balanced. We were recommended the Beef Bourguignon and I’m so glad I had it. Slow cooked for hours you don’t need a knife, the beef just pulls apart, paired with mash which is more butter than potato, I loved it and I don’t even like Mash. My wife had the ravioli which was again, perfectly balanced, full of flavour and perfectly cooked. We always pick a winner between us and this was just impossible (although I was the winner - shhh). We rarely order dessert but the options were so great we just had to try the chocolate fondant. Served with chilled clotted cream instead of boring vanilla ice cream it was sensational.<br /><br />Because of the insane quality, it’s hard not to draw comparison to the top fine dining restaurants of London, in which case, it would have been nice to have varietal stemware (a big ask on only a £42 bottle of wine) however that said, the manager actually offered to ready Bordeaux glasses for our next visit as they have a sister restaurant who are stocked. I mean, if that’s not top tier service I don’t know what is. <br /><br />This place could give the heavy hitters in London a run for their money, and at a much smaller cost it’s a no brainier.

As they were all of similar price I sought advice from the waiter.  Were the sharing  platters meant for two or small tapas-style dishes.  The reply was not very helpful but did clarify that they were all starters.  This meant they worked out quite expensive and double the price of usual sharing dishes being from aroun£11-£14 each.   They were tasty and well-presented.  My main of chicken in a tomato and fenugreek sauce was sublime - creamy without being rich and I was not disappointed at all.  The chargrilled broccoli florets had clearly only been briefly introduced to the griddle and were almost a crudités.  They have a very good wine list with a good range of prices.

Dinner for two with a bottle of relatively inexpensive wine (£45:00) and cocktails ( £14:00 each) with service just north of £250 ! Once you&#039;re seated, there is little point in skimping on what you want to eat, the signature black cod is a whopping £42:00 for a single size portion, yet don&#039;t be tempted for a half size at £22:00, that would be gone in two mouthfuls.<br />The food is delicious but even for central London at these prices this is really for very special occasions.",5,5.0,5.0,4.0,3.0,2014-02-15

Mine was medium/well, more to well. I told the waiter who started hacking into the steak, trying to prove it was not overcooked. He then grumpily took it away saying that he’ll order a rare steak then. The steak came out a few minutes later, and it was blue rare, not something I’d usually eat.

5558,100194,"Avoid, if you want food or decent service. Our experience here was absolutely appalling!<br /><br />This was booked for a Bank Holiday Monday to celebrate my Birthday with my family, whom I rarely see. When we arrived we were guided upstairs, to our table, that was not ready. On top of this, they set the table in such a way that meant the 5th person was not able to sit down anywhere.  We were then left for 15/20 minutes before the staff actually came to take any form of order.<br /><br />The experience got worse, when one of the party asked for some tap water, the waitress gave him a look of contempt and continued to ask what else he would be drinking. Another member of the party asked for a pint of San Miguel and got an opened bottle partially poured into a glass, so hard to reject. When someone asked for a specific beer, instead of apologising and explaining that the beer was off, the waitress just said, &#039;No, we don&#039;t have that, it&#039;s a bank holiday.&#039; <br /><br />When we finally came to ordering food, the waitress failed to tell us that half the menu was off. After we started ordering, we kept being told &#039;No.&#039; without explanation. Apparently the Bank Holiday means they don&#039;t have as much food or beer. Again when explaining this, the waitress was incredibly rude, no apologies at any point, just saying that this is expected on a Bank Holiday, which it isn&#039;t. When you have lots of tables booked for the day, food and drink should be ensured that there is enough, and when there isn&#039;t enough, actually say sorry.<br /><br />After all this, we decided to move elsewhere, as the service was awful and we actually wanted food that we could eat, as someone who doesn&#039;t eat meat, there was one option left, which I thought was terrible for a birthday. When we said we would like the bill and to leave, the waitress came over with a card machine and just put her hand out for a card, without actually giving us a bill or a price. <br /><br />Overall, go to a different pub in the area, much better nearby(Three crowns)",1,1.0,2.0,1.0,1.0,2018-05-28

This was compounded by our table, which frankly should not have been a table.

Our table was located against the back wall  offered a full view of the very busy noisy main restaurant and I would suggested it’s not the place for a romantic meal for two. It’s a very  lively place and perhaps best enjoyed as a group. <br /><br />Prices seemed reasonable considering the location and particularly good  value with the offer from Buyagift. All the food we received was excellent however we did have some issues with the service. <br /><br />I had ordered Rib-eye steak and received the wrong sauce and requested it to be exchanged. I waited and waited and so started my meal and realised that I had not been brought a steak knife. I continued to wait  trying to catch the eye of one of the busy waiting staff which was difficult and so started to try to continue with a normal knife. Eventually I received my sauce (and a proper knife) and tried a small amount to find that it was totally cold. <br /><br />Again I had to  wait to report my disappointment, and the waiter walked away after a muted  apology leaving me slightly bemused. I continued with my meal without the sauce (lucky I hadn&#039;t poured it all on) and when the waiter eventually return and touched the sauce pot, he again apologised but at that point I had finished my meal.<br /><br />The waiter returned 5 minutes later with a couple of glasses of wine as an apology from the chef, nice but I do not drink  wine (only my wife had previously ordered wine) and so we were appreciative but equally bemused. <br /><br />Bottom line, great food but some basic service errors from a very well established  restaurant was surprising, disappointing and slightly tarnished the experience.<br /><br />Lovely food but patchy service slightly tarnished the experience.",3,4.0,3.0,3.0,3.0,2018-11-16

After reading some reviews I was a little apprehensive about the level of service, waiting, food that we would experience.<br />The service was great, always tended to as and when required.  The food did take nearly an hour to come out, and we were given complementary cocktails as an apology for this.  We sat in the courtyard which was nice and not as noisy as inside (there are blankets on every chair).  The food was very well presented, and very yummy.  We struggled to finish, so were given a doggy bag to take the remainder home.  <br />This is expensive, so I would suggest it for a special treat, however it was very nice, the service was great, the food delicious.  <br />Thoroughly enjoyed.",5,5.0,5.0,5.0,3.0,2019-11-09

The teas were really fun and the decor/presentation was creative and really true to the theme. We were served by Kai (I think that’s the right spelling) and he was brilliant, very friendly and knowledgeable and he really made our visit special. Nothing was too much trouble and we were able to get extra clotted cream and water without a long wait.

The afternoon tea itself looked and sounded awesome, however the taste and execution of the different elements didn&#039;t live up to their appearance.  The cakes were stodgy and heavy and a lot of the flavours seemed unbalanced, either flavourless or far too rich.

However, this only meant that our food expectations were quite high. While the quiche and the victoria sponge were divine, the sandwiches were little more than dried up squished sandwiches and the mango cheesecake was tasteless.

We both opted for the set menu, which at three courses with a half bottle of wine, petit fours and coffee seemed good value for money.  The starter was ok as was the wine, however I ordered the pork belly for main course have specifically asked the waiter if the meat would be fatty.  He assured me that although there would be a little fat, it would not be too much.  When my meal arrived, the meat was almost all fat and inedible.  I did send it back and it was substituted for the fish, which was ok.   There was very little choice for dessert none of which appealed to me, so I just had ice cream.  Although the inclusion of the wine in the price makes the lunch reasonably good value for money, I was unimpressed and would probably not be in a hurry to go back there again.",3,3.0,4.0,4.0,3.0,2016-02-24

He sent the sommelier round, who actually sniffed when she asked him for a recommendation. He said she should just order anything.  I asked a waiter for more bread, at which we looked at me and smiled broadly. Oh dear,  how un-cultured of us. Set the tone really for the evening really!

We placed our orders and noticed the place soon filling up. But then we noticed that people that came after us and ordered after us were getting their dishes. I did hear the head waiter point out to one of his staff that someone sitting near us was a &quot;good, regular customer&quot;. Not us obviously!!<br /><br />Finally after 40 minutes from arriving our 1st course arrives. Except there is only one of them, the special asparagus soup. It&#039;s missing the mascarpone cheese which is in my partners when it arrives 8 minutes later. Our mains take another 15 minutes to appear after having our plates cleared. The polpette meatballs were luke warm while my standard spag bog was nuclear hot. <br /><br />We asked for the bill and mentioned the 20% off deal for booking via here. The waiter doesn&#039;t know anything about it and brings the manager who acknowledges it. A further 10 to 15 mins pass and no bill and no sign of our waiter so we flag another down and ask for the bill. Another 10 mins pass and I get fed up and go to the till and unknowingly bypass the waiter with my bill. He brings it back to me and the 20% discount has not been taken off. A profuse apology from the manager saying he&#039;d been suddenly swamped with people wanting to leave (funny that, given that it was Saturday  night in the Theatre district, you&#039;d think he may have noticed it happens all the time). The 20% off is only on the food portion, not the total bill as per this site. I would have saved a further pound, but the will to leave at this point was too great and I just gave up. <br /><br />Thankfully the evening was saved by the show we saw, but it was an extremely disappointing trip to what normally is faithful stalwart of cheapish West End dining.

Apart from the ravioli ordered by one of our party the food was really good. Service was friendly but could have been a little more on the ball - we had to reorder forgotten drinks a few times as the waiter appeared to be confused by our addition of more mojitos on top of the ones inclusive of the meal deal.,4,4.0,4.0,3.0,5.0,2009-04-20

My steak was cooked to my liking and was good value, however my partners choice was inedible and approximately 75% was left uneaten, a complaint was made and dealt with very well by the very young staff. The bill was adjusted and no payment was taken for the pastry, i feel that this may have been attributed to the fact the restaurant was busy coupled with the usual lack of attention to vegetarian options.

The menu was very limited and a schools canteen would have been more interesting and better. I had chopped liver to begin with which was nothing more than a very thinly spread creamy pate on French toasted bread and not tasting of chopped liver at all. For the main course I had what was supposed to be spicy jerk chicken with pineapple but was as bland as anything with no spice at all and the pineapple was three strips one of which was total core. My wife had what was supposed to be cod cooked in matzo meal but was in fact cooked in batter. It was almost inedible and when she queried this, because someone at the next table also had cod but this was cooked in matzo meal, we were told that they would make a deduction from the bill.

6539,70858,"This may seem a bit harsh, but it&#039;s 100% accurate.<br /><br />I purchased this using a groupon for my family while we visited London.  The Groupon is completely misleading, if not fraudulent. <br /><br />The Groupon we purchased told us that we could order up to one Mai Tai, one appetizer (up to a certain value), one main course (up to certain value) and one dessert (up to a certain value), this is completely misleading.<br /><br />When you arrive and tell them you have a Groupon, they give you a completely different menu which is also different than the menu that is on the web....and different from the standard menu.  You can not order dishes off of the regular menu up to the price limits that are indicated on the Groupon.<br /><br />When I showed this to the manager (who was actually very nice), I was told &quot;we don&#039;t tell Groupon what to put in the coupon.&quot;  This is also not true....but why was I surprised....like Groupon writes them for restaurants on their own?<br /><br />To make things worse, the food that we ate was terrible.  A good example is fried calamari which looks like tons of bread fried on the worst calamari I ever had.  My daughter had a curried Shrimp.  They told her that the shrimp was not one of the choices and they charged a $10 up charge - &quot;although we remained under the limit stated on the groupon.&quot;  To boot, the shrimp were small, tasteless and had a rubber like texture.<br /><br />You may actually like the food if you are also frozen in time from 1983 like this restaurant.<br /><br />A few more observations.  The curry dishes come with approximately 10 things that you can add.  The problem is that they are seemingly, unrelated to the curry dish that they are serving - like hot sauce on chocolate ice cream.<br /><br />As far as the Mai Tai....no liquor.  The upside is that they give you plenty of ice.  My wife commented after tasting her Mai Tai &quot;I think I may have to stop drinking if somebody serves this to me again.&quot;  Nobody in our party drank their cocktails.",1,,,,,2018-12-30
